MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 

1-2 NAVAIR (NA) 00-25-100 describes the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Technical 
Publications Library Management Program and provides procedures for operating and maintaining a 
Central or Dispersed Technical Publications Library.  These procedures are mandatory for all Naval 
Aviation units as directed by COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2. 

1-3 NA 00-25-100 was prepared for usage as a digital manual and optimized for usage in Portable 
Document File (PDF) format.  On the computer, addition of hyperlinks enables the user to easily access 
the referenced work packages (WPs), paragraphs, and e-mail addresses.  Website addresses in this 
issue are not linked due to security within the respective firewall.  Copy the website address and paste 
into Internet Explorer to utilize the website address.  After "jumping" to a hyperlinked reference, use the 
"Back arrow" key of the Adobe command line to return to your "previous view" location. 

1-4 Technical manuals (TMs), Technical Directives (TDs), Military Specifications/Standards (MIL-
SPECs/STDs), and other references cited in the text of this manual are identified by the basic number.  
For example, the directive COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2B will be identified as COMNAVAIRFORINST 
4790.2.  Refer to WP 016 00 for the listing of latest referenced TMs, TDs, MIL-SPECs/STDs, and any 
other references utilized at the time of publishing this TM.  It is the responsibility of the user to determine 
the current status of any references being used. 

1-5 NA 00-25-100 will be viewable on the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center 
(NATEC) website only.  The reference may be printed out from the PDF format for use as a hard copy 
manual.  Control of this manual will be in accordance with WP 013 00. 

2-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL PROGRAM 

2-2 NA 00-25-604 provides NAVAIR TM providers and managers with guidance and an overview of the 
scope of the NAVAIR processes for the acquisition and life cycle management of NAVAIR technical 
publications.  In addition, the manual also assigned roles and responsibilities for establishing, managing, 
monitoring and executing end-to-end TM processes. 

3-1 USE OF THE TECHNICAL MANUAL 

3-2 Navy TMs contain a description of weapons systems, weapons, components, and equipment with 
instructions for their use and maintenance.  TMs are usually divided into two main types: operations and 
maintenance.  They are grouped in a variety of categories predicated on the type of equipment used and 
the intended maintenance requirements.  

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 002 00 
30 December 2014  

2 

3-3 Some of the more frequently seen categories are: operations manuals, such as Naval Air Training 
and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) Flight Manual and associated pocket checklists 
and Tactical Manual/Naval Aviation Technical Information Product (TACMAN/NATIP); maintenance 
manuals such as Maintenance Instruction Manuals (MIMs), including wiring repair manuals (WRMs), 
structural repair manuals (SRMs), and illustrated parts breakdown (IPB) manuals.  A complete list of 
manuals is provided in WP 004 00.  

3-4 NAVAIR Logistics Product Data Competency (AIR 6.8.5) is assigned the responsibility of 
establishing, managing and monitoring the end-to-end policies, processes and execution for TMs.  
NAVAIR Code 6.8.5 Competency acts as the primary fleet champion for ensuring NAVAIR technical 
publication products have quality content and usability, in addition to this work package, which contains 
an overview of the TM management processes and the individual roles and responsibilities are 
standardized for “look and feel,” and distributed by standard processes in a timely manner.  

3-5 It must be recognized not every task or maintenance procedure must, or will, are described in the 
manual.  Standard shop practice, basic technical knowledge, task complexity and safety considerations 
are governing criteria for determining new manual requirements and/or change or revision requirements 
to existing manuals.  When local user activity controversy arises concerning these areas, Type 
Commanders (TYCOMs) must render a decision concerning use or applicability. 

3-6 When new instructions or procedures are required they will be incorporated into the TMs.  Users can 
contribute to manual change through the utilization of the Technical Publications Deficiency Report 
(TPDR) through Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS) (WP 015 00).  For NATOPS flight and Tactical 
manuals, OPNAV Form 3710/6, NATOPS/Tactical Change Recommendation, other acceptable means as 
specified in OPNAVINST 3710.7 or Airworthiness Issue Resolution System (AIRS website) shall be used 
(WP 015 00).  

4-1 COMPETENCY ALIGNED ORGANIZATION/INTEGRATED PROGRAM TEAM (CAO/IPT) ROLES 
AND RESPONSIBILTIES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNICAL MANUALS 

4-2 The Program Management Office (PMO), through the Integrated Program Team/Fleet Support Team 
(IPT/FST), Logistics Element Managers (LEMs) or Data Managers (DMs) organization, identifies the need 
for TMs in support of new weapon systems, subsystems, support equipment, related hardware, firmware, 
or software procurements, or in support of hardware or software modification procurements, i.e., 
approved Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs).  

4-3 Product Data Competency personnel are assigned responsibility for overall policy and processes for 
the centralized acquisition and sustainment of TMs.  This responsibility entails development and 
maintenance of policy, procedures and specifications that ensure distribution and documentation that will 
effectively support weapons and equipment in the hands of the fleet user. 

4-4 Under the CAO/IPT the Logistics Product Data Competency (AIR 6.8.5) is assigned the responsibility 
of establishing, managing, and monitoring the end-to-end policies, processes and execution thereof for 
technical publications.  The AIR Code 6.8.5 Competency acts as the primary fleet champion for ensuring 
that NAVAIR’s technical publication products achieve quality in content and usability, are standardized in 
“look and feel,” and are distributed by standard processes in a timely manner. 

4-5 The LEM is the single point of contact for the program for all matters relating to the end-to-end 
management of publications for that program.  The LEM’s responsibilities include coordination and 
management of efforts across NAVAIR sites/organizations and contractors producing TMs.  The LEM 
area of responsibility extends to oversight of IPT processes that may affect fleet Central Technical 
Publications Library (CTPL) management of the TM product.  Competency managers should be engaged 
early in order to partner with programs to avoid stovepipe corporate or fleet processes.  

4-6 AUTHORIZED ISSUING COMMANDS.  TMs issued within the naval establishment for aircraft and 
related systems operation and maintenance are issued under the direction of the Commander, Naval Air 
Systems Command.  Those TMs concerned with flight personnel training and air operations are issued by 
the authority of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and under the direction of the Commander, Naval 
Air Systems Command.

4-7 DIGITAL NAVAIR TECHNICAL DATA.  NAVAIR Code 6.8.5 Competency defines all policies 
relative to the creation, storage and distribution of digital technical data for NAVAIR.  NATEC enforces all 
policies relative to the creation, storage, and distribution of digital technical data for NAVAIR.  The driving 
force behind NAVAIR technical data policy is to ensure configuration management standardization and 
ease of use by the fleet maintainer. 

4-8 To ensure configuration management and control of technical data, NATEC is designated as the 
central repository for all NAVAIR TMs, whether they are in paper or digital format.  NATEC will distribute 
TMs in paper, CD-ROM, DVD or any other digital format.  Any deviation from this policy will require a 
written waiver from NAVAIR Code 6.8.5 Competency. 

4-9 The NATEC website and/or Joint Knowledge Caching Server (JKCS) are the ONLY official 
repositories for storage and distribution of NAVAIR TMs.  If there is a difference in configuration between 
the NATEC Website and JKCS, the NATEC Website will be the authoritative source.  Distribution of 
NAVAIR TMs for maintenance purposes without a written waiver from NAVAIR Code 6.8.5 Competency is 
prohibited.  Additional data is available concerning digital TMs in WP 011 00. 

5-1 USE OF OTHER NAVY/ARMY/AIR FORCE PUBLICATIONS IN THE NAVAIR SYSTEM 

5-2 In addition to the documents prepared and published by NAVAIR, the Technical Manual Program 
uses various TMs and publications prepared by other Naval Systems Commands, the U.S. Army, and the 
U.S. Air Force.  In most cases, joint use TMs will be issued a publication number by each using service 
with the top number being the service having cognizance of the manual, i.e., Navy, Air Force, and Army. 

5-3 Joint use Air Force and Army TMs should be requisitioned in accordance with the instructions 
identified in WP 006 00.  Requisition other NAVAIR publications media by following the procedural 
instructions appearing in WP 006 00. 

6-1 APPROVED TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY PROGRAM 

6-2 The NATEC Technical Manual Application System (TMAPS) Enhanced Library Management System 
(ELMS) is the only automated system authorized for use in managing NAVAIR technical data in the 
CTPL.  The ELMS application user is not required to submit an Automatic Distribution Requirements List 
(ADRL) because their requirements are updated as "real time" via the NATEC TMAPS website.  For 
further guidelines in validating TMs maintained by the customer, refer to WP 010 00. 

6-3 If assistance is required, please contact a Technical Publications Specialist (TPS) (WP 003 00) or 
send email to nani_customerservice@navy.mil. 

7-1 USE OF SHALL, SHOULD, MAY AND WILL 

7-2 The usage and intended meaning of “shall,” “should,” “may,” and “will” utilized in the preparation of 
this publication as follows:  

"Shall" means procedure is mandatory.  

"Should" means procedure is recommended.  

"May" and "need not" mean procedure is optional.  

"Will" indicates futurity and never indicates any degree of requirement for application of a procedure.  Use

1-1 GENERAL 

1-2 This work package (WP) contains descriptive information concerning the many elements of naval 
aviation that are covered by technical manuals (TMs).  It is intended to make the user aware of the many 
and diverse categories of manuals required to properly support the operation and maintenance of naval 
aircraft and equipment. 

1-3 Once the category of a manual is determined, code numbers are assigned to manuals for the 
purpose of identification.  The numerical and alphabetical combination of a NAVAIR TM number identifies 
the basic equipment category, main groups within the category, specific item of equipment, type of usage, 
type or model designation and specific type of manual.  Code numbers are identified as the conventional 
numbering system and the Technical Manual Identification Numbering System (TMINS). 

2-1 TYPES OF TECHNICAL MANUALS 

2-2 TMs are divided into two major types, operational and maintenance.  These manuals are the basic 
source of information for definition of operating instructions, tactical applications, and the maintenance 
and upkeep of hardware.  They are also the main source of support for a training program. 

2-3 OPERATIONAL MANUALS are manuals and other forms of documentation that contain a 
description of weapon systems with instructions for their effective use.  These manuals, i.e., Naval Air 
Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS), tactical manuals, weapons loading, etc., 
contain informative descriptions of the weapon system, systems integration, operating instructions, 
operational application, safety and emergency procedures and other pertinent data exclusive of 
maintenance procedures.  These manuals cover peculiar weapon system requirements for pilot training 
and flight instructions, aircraft tactics, including operational requirements related to computer initiated 
functions and actions, weapons loading, and in selected cases, cargo handling. 

2-4 Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization Flight Manual 

a. NATOPS Flight Manual (NFM) is written for a specific piloted aircraft or unmanned air vehicle (UAV) 
and contains standardized ground and flight operating procedures, training requirements, and technical 
data necessary for the safe and effective operation of the aircraft or UAV.  NATOPS flight manuals do not 
include tactical doctrine.  They are compiled and kept current by fleet reviews. 

b. Each NFM contains a Letter of Promulgation (LOP) signed by the officer delegated such authority by 
the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).  NATOPS flight manuals are normally unclassified publications.  

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 004 00 
30 December 2014 

2 

Classified subject matter may be placed in a NATOPS flight manual supplement in order to maintain an 
unclassified NATOPS flight manual. 

2-5 Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization Manual (General Series) 

Different from a NATOPS flight manual in that it contains general system descriptions and procedures or 
reference information for aircraft-related operations and evolutions (e.g. Aircraft Refueling NATOPS, 
Aircraft Carrier (CV) NATOPS, Landing Signal Officer [(LSO) NATOPS] and is normally not for just one 
model of aircraft or UAV.  This manual is subject to the same standardized formatting requirements as 
NATOPS flight manuals, but its chapters are organized appropriately for the subject addressed by the 
publication title.  

2-6 Pilot’s Pocket Checklists/Flight Crew Checklists 

An abbreviated extension to NATOPS data released in a special “knee pad” checklist format.  They 
contain performance and reference data and emergency, normal, and special procedures.  They are step-
by-step abbreviations of the amplified NATOPS manual procedures prepared for direct cockpit 
application. 

2-7 Functional Check Flight Checklists 

These are required to determine whether the airframe, power plant, accessories, and other items of 
equipment are functioning in accordance with predetermined standards while subjected to the intended 
operating environment.  Such flights are conducted when it is not possible to determine proper operation 
by ground checks, i.e., aerodynamic reaction, air loading, or signal propagation. 

2-8 Tactical Manuals 

Supplement the NATOPS flight manual.  Described therein is information on tactics, weaponry, and air 
combat maneuvering with procedures and techniques to be used that are based on tactical situations and 
mission assignments.  These documents are also under CNO cognizance, and as a result thereof, are 
integrated into the Naval Warfare Publication (NWP) program. 

2-9 Airborne Weapons/Stores Loading Manuals 

Promulgate information required to convert aircraft armament systems to respond to various mission 
assignments, perform functional checkout of aircraft weapons control and release systems, and describe 
the loading/unloading of airborne weapons or stores.  The manual explains standard loading criteria and 
procedures predicated on tactical doctrine.  These documents are also released under a LOP specifying 
that the procedures stipulated are mandatory. 

2-10 Weapons Loading Checklists 

These are abbreviated step-by-step procedures taken from the amplified procedures displayed in the 
weapon/stores loading manuals.  Normally used for training as well as for direct loading/unloading 
support. 

2-11 Cargo Loading Manuals 

Publications prepared for selected cargo-type aircraft.  They contain procedures for loading, securing, 
and unloading of cargo.  As far as possible, all typical loads (ground equipment, troops, engines, etc.) and 
other assigned transport missions are covered and illustrated.  Displayed information covers the 
description of the aircraft and its cargo features, the preparation of the aircraft for loading, general 
instructions for cargo loading/unloading, load security, and loading of specialized cargo.  Most cargo 
loading documentation is subject to controls identical to NATOPS.

2-12 MAINTENANCE MANUALS are documents containing a description and instruction for the effective 
use and support of the weapon system from a viewpoint of upkeep and repair.  These manuals 
incorporate maintenance procedure information such as operation, troubleshooting, fault detection, 
installation, testing, assembly, disassembly, repair, and supply support in the form of an illustrated parts 
breakdown (IPB). 

2-13 General Engineering Series Manuals 

General Engineering Series manuals cover standard aviation maintenance practices, which apply to all 
aircraft rather than to a particular type, model, or series.  These documents serve as useful training tools 
and preclude duplication of standard practices in other manuals.  In the event that there is a conflict 
between the manual for a specific system and the procedures contained in the general engineering series 
manual, the latest dated issue of either the maintenance manual or general engineering series manual 
shall take precedence. 

2-14 Technical Documentation List 

Prepared similar to an index but structured with a view to assisting maintenance personnel in the 
selection of appropriate manuals required for maintenance support.  All manuals applicable to a weapon 
system are listed.  These listings are presented in three basic formats: Numerically by assigned TM 
number; system, subsystem, and component part number or type designator to TM number; and by 
Support Equipment part number or type designator to TM number.  This index is referred to by other 
titles: Technical Manual List, Aircraft Documentation List, or List of Applicable Publications. 

2-15 Maintenance Instruction Manuals 

Maintenance Instruction Manuals (MIMs) provide both general and specific instructions which are 
required for maintenance at organizational, intermediate, or depot levels of maintenance on aircraft, 
weapons systems, equipment, components, and support equipment.  

2-16 Wiring Manuals 

Wiring Manuals comprised of wiring data/diagram, wiring list, wiring repair, wiring connector repair, and 
functional flow diagram documentation. 

● Wiring data/diagram manuals describe functions and makeup of each power control/signal as 
interfaced with mechanical systems and in composite wiring information for all systems, 
subsystems, and equipment as installed in an aircraft weapon system. 

● Wire lists are computer generated tabular listings used as reference data to cross reference wire 
number to junction point list and junction point to wire number list. 

● A wire repair manual furnishes temporary and permanent repair data for every wire used in an 
aircraft weapon system.  The wire connector repair document comprehensively supplies all 
maintenance information requirements for disassembly, repair, and assembly of each specific 
wiring connector. 

● Functional flow diagram publications are maintenance support documents, used in conjunction 
with troubleshooting procedures to provide point-to-point closed loop wiring of the aircraft weapon 
system and its systems and subsystems. 

2-17 General Aircraft Information Manual 

General Aircraft Information Manual may be subdivided into Plane Captain’s Manual, Ground Handling 
Manual, and General Information and Servicing Manual.  Contained therein is a general description of the 
aircraft, which shows dimensions, aircraft stations, access openings, engine operation, ground or carrier 
handling/servicing, hazardous areas, and emergency procedures.

2-18 Weight and Balance Data Manuals (NAVAIR 01-1B-40, NAVAIR 01-1B-50) 

a. Used jointly with the U.S. Air Force.  They provide a standard system for recording field weight and 
balance of certain aircraft.  The original manufacturer prior to delivery of the aircraft to the Navy prepares 
the initial development of forms, charts, and records contained in the manual. 

b. The document remains with the aircraft during its entire service life and provides a means of 
maintaining a continuous, current record of the aircraft’s basic weight, balance, and loading data.  The 
records are maintained by the aircraft-reporting custodian and overhaul activities and must be brought up-
to-date prior to any transfer of aircraft. 

c. NAVAIR 01-1B-50, USN Aircraft Weight and Balance Control Manual, provides requirements, 
procedures, and responsibilities for weight and balance control of Navy aircraft. 

2-19 Crew Station/In-Flight Maintenance Manuals 

These manuals are specifically designed for large, high-density avionics aircraft employing sophisticated 
computer-controlled, integrated weapon systems.  They are an aid in maintaining mission capability and 
assist in accomplishment of rapid fault detection and possible corrective action while the aircraft is still 
airborne and are prepared to the same general specifications as aircraft manuals.  However, they are 
tailored to their specific functional application.  Information covers basic description, theory and 
troubleshooting, checkout, assembly, disassembly, maintenance, servicing, and handling. 

2-20 Airborne Missile Weapons Assembly Checklists 

Provide an abbreviated, unclassified, procedural reference, which can be used as a guide for step-by-
step assembly of missiles or weapons. 

2-21 Structural Repair Manuals 

Contains specialized repair information required by maintenance personnel to determine the extent of 
aircraft structural damage and instructions for performing a permanent or one time flight repair. 

2-22 Illustrated Parts Breakdown Manuals 

a. IPBs contain a listing of weapon systems/component parts keyed to line art illustrations.  The IPB 
serves a dual function to assist both maintenance and supply.  Material is illustrated by exploded view, 
listed in the order of top-down breakdown and referenced to material availability through Source, 
Maintenance, and Recoverability (SM&R) code listings.  

b. The IPB is prepared as a part of the WP, but also may be an associated document to the related 
maintenance manual or incorporated in the basic manual as a separate WP.  It is used to identify, 
requisition, issue, and provide information on storing parts required for maintenance support. 

2-23 Power Plants Manuals 

a. Referred to as reciprocating engines, jet propulsion/turbo shaft engines, rocket type jet engines, and 
Auxiliary Power Units (APUs).  Organizational (installed) maintenance is covered in the power plants 
volume of the MIM prepared by the aircraft manufacturer.  However, uninstalled intermediate and depot 
information is defined in specialized engine documentation prepared by the engine manufacturer. 

b. Content coverage extends from intermediate servicing and repairs to Complete Engine Repair (CER) 
to overhaul, all with an IPB.  In some cases, CER is supported by a deck of Complete Engine Repair 
Requirements Cards (CERRCs). 

2-24 Planned Maintenance System 

a. Planned Maintenance System (PMS) documentation is a series of manuals that portray selected 
maintenance requirements and inspections.  These manuals provide the basis for planning, scheduling, 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 004 00 
30 December 2014 

5 

and actual performance of scheduled maintenance requirements.  The requirements are scheduled with 
intervals based on the predominant failure mode, such as calendar time, flight/operation hours, or 
numbers of cycles/events. 

b. Some of the more important applications are: 

● Turnaround Checklists have been prepared to support inspection of exterior and interior aircraft 
surfaces in an abbreviated walk-around order.  The requirements cover those items necessary to 
determine obvious defects that may have occurred during each flight, i.e., pre-operational, post-
operational. 

● Daily/Special/Preservation/Conditional/Aircraft Service Period Adjustment (ASPA) Manuals cover 
the minimum daily inspection requirements, as well as servicing, special inspections, and, if 
applicable, conditional inspections.  Special inspections are defined as those that are performed 
on a prescribed number of days, flight hours, operating hours, or cycles.  After thorough cleaning 
has been accomplished, preservation inspections are made of all areas of the aircraft for 
evidence of corrosion or other deterioration in order to permit accurate assessment of the 
preservation process at the end of the preservation period.  Conditional inspections are 
unscheduled inspections that must be accomplished as the result of an overstressed or over limit 
condition, i.e., excessive “G” forces, hard landings, over speed or over temp engines, etc.  ASPA 
evaluations are conditional maintenance actions, which are depot level evaluations of aircraft 
general material condition. 

● Phase Maintenance Requirements Cards divide the total scheduled maintenance requirements 
into small packages (phases) of approximately the same work content, which are accomplished 
sequentially at specific intervals. 

● Periodic Maintenance Information Cards (PMIC) identifies all scheduled or forced removal items 
and their replacement intervals.  They also contain a record of applicable technical directives, a 
maintenance requirements index (by system), and a conditional inspection listing. 

● Airborne Weapons Assembly Manuals provide organizational and intermediate maintenance 
activities with detailed information for weapons uncanning/recanning and inspection, component 
unpackaging/repackaging and inspection, and weapons assembly and inspection criteria for 
assembled weapons. 

● Cross Servicing Schedules/Guides contain information required by North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) activities for spares and servicing of U. S. Navy and Marine Corps aircraft 
without the use of special types of equipment. 

3-1 OTHER TECHNICAL MANUALS 

3-2 OTHER TECHNICAL MANUALS are grouped in a variety of categories predicated on the type of 
equipment used and the peculiarities of the maintenance requirement.  The following paragraphs identify 
and briefly explain each of the more frequently seen categories (figure 1). 

3-3 Technical Manuals for Research and Development 

TMs for Research and Development (R&D) shall be no more complete or extensive in coverage than 
essential to support operation and onsite maintenance during the life of the test program.  Documentation

operational units to accomplish rapid repair of battle damaged aircraft that will increase aircraft 
availability, sortie generation, and continued capacity to fight in wartime, and, in the long term, increase 
the capability of the technicians to accomplish any repair in the aircraft.  It must be stressed that the 
ABDR manual will only be used when authorized by the theatre commander. 

6-1 OTHER TYPES OF TECHNICAL MANUALS, PUBLICATIONS AND DOCUMENTS  

6-2 OTHER TYPES OF TECHNICAL MANUALS, PUBLICATIONS AND DOCUMENTS which may be 

retained by the CTPL are listed in the following paragraphs. 

6-3 Department of Defense Publications 

a. Navy TMs, because of multiple applications, are used jointly between other elements of the Navy 
(i.e. NAVSEA and SPAWAR) and other services (i.e. U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force).  These documents 
will normally carry the identification number of each using service. 

b. They will be under the management control of the primary executive service, which can be easily 
identified because its TM will be the top number on the title page of the TM.  However, to simplify 
research, their NAVAIR number will be indexed in Naval Logistics Library (NLL) website (NAVSUP 
P2003). 

6-4 Automated Type Technical Manuals 

Automated type technical manuals do not follow normal documentation practices and standards.  They 
can appear on tape, film or compact discs.  Most of these items are used in conjunction with programmed 
automatic or semiautomatic test equipment.  They are used to operate or monitor the operation of the 
equipment. 

6-5 Commercial Manuals, Manufacturer’s Service Bulletins, Maintenance Digests, and Other 
Periodicals 

Guidelines prepared by weapons system and equipment manufacturers which are normally not 
authorized nor approved for distribution to naval personnel.  An exception to this is when weapon system, 
sub-system, or support equipment is received from a weapon system and/or equipment manufacturer with 
only the manufacturers/commercial manual available. 

7-1 NUMBER DESIGNATIONS FOR MAJOR CATEGORIES OF NAVAIR MANUALS 

7-2 NAVAIR TMs are grouped into major categories (figure 1) to assist in the understanding of manual 
number assignments.  Representative examples of number prefixes are listed in figure 2. 

7-3 Both the NAVAIR numbers and comparable TMINS number are shown where available.  NAVAIR 
numbered manuals (known as conventional numbering) will not be reassigned TMINS numbers and 
neither will TMINS numbered manuals be reassigned NAVAIR numbers.  A dual system, conventional 
and TMINS will remain in effect indefinitely. 

7-4 Code numbers are assigned to manuals for the purpose of identification.  The numerical and 
alphabetical combination of a NAVAIR TM number identifies the basic equipment category, main groups 
within the category, specific item of equipment, type of usage, type or model designation and specific type 
of manual.  Code numbers are identified as the conventional numbering system and the Technical 
Manual Identification Numbering System (TMINS). 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 004 00

7-5 CONVENTIONAL NUMBERING SYSTEM.  The NAVAIR manual conventional numbering system 
consists of a prefix and combination of numbers and letters divided into three parts separated by dashes 
(figure 3).  Additional numbers may be added to designate multiple volumes of a manual. 

a. The TM prefix, i.e., NAVAIR, identifies the command responsible for developing and maintaining the 
manual (figure 3). 

b. The three parts that make up the remaining portions of the number are as follows: 

● Part I of the TM number is a two digit number (in some cases, two digits and a letter) that 
designate the general subject classification or major category of the manual, i.e., 01 for airframes, 
02 for power plants, 03 for accessories, etc.  

● Part ll of the TM number consists of numbers and/or numbers and letters that identify either the 
basic aircraft model, manufacturer of specific aircraft and engine or the specific class, group, or 
subcategory of the manual, i.e., NAVAIR 01-E2AAA (Northrop Grumman), 01-75PAA (Lockheed 
Aeronautical Systems Company), 02B-10 (Pratt & Whitney) or NAVAIR 03-110 (jet engine fuel 
system and related equipment). 

● Part llI of the TM number may or may not have identifiable numerical significance within the 
airframe, missile, and power plant series.  The number usually identifies a particular type of 
manual, i.e., NAVAIR 01-XXXX-2 (-2 maintenance), NAVAIR 01-XXXXX-3 (-3 structural repair), 
NAVAIR 01-XXXXX-4 (-4 IPB), etc. (figure 4). 
● Additional numbers may be added to indicate system grouping breakout by volume or 

subsystem grouping by sub-volume, i.e., NAVAIR 01-XXXX-2-2.  The second -2 indicates the 
second volume of the maintenance series, which is usually grouped by system.  Periods in a 
TM number should only be used when a manual is part of a multivolume set due to its size 
and requires more than one 3-inch binder to store it in. 

● If the number assignment is NAVAIR 01-XXXX-2-2.3 (or 01-XXX-2-2-3), the .3 (or -3) 
indicates a sub-volume or sub-system within a grouping.  This system does not hold true in all 
cases.  In many TM number assignments, the suffix numbers are assigned in numerical 
sequence for identification only and have no significance as to the type of manual. 

7-6 TECHNICAL MANUAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERING SYSTEM (TMINS).  The TMINS is a 
numbering system developed in coordination with other Systems Commands.  This change was in 
response to a Naval Material Command sponsored project for standardizing TM numbers and their 
method of assignment. 

7-7 The numbering system was promulgated by N0000-00-IDX-000/TMINS.  The NAVAIR version of the 
TMINS was implemented by NATEC.  The intent of TMINS was to provide a single user oriented 
numbering and indexing system and to satisfy the requirements of the Naval Material Systems Command 
for identifying, referencing, and requisitioning TMs and their associated revisions/changes. 

7-8 TMINS assigns each TM a unique identifying alphanumeric number patterned after the 13 digit stock 
number, i.e., 0000-LP-000-0000.  The 13-character TMINS number serves as the TM identification 
number.  In addition to its identification number, TMINS contains a provision for adding a suffix, using a C, 
for confidential and an, S, for secret. 

7-9 TMINS numbers are not to be used for requisitioning purposes.  Use stock numbers for 
requisitioning. 

7-10 Construction 

a. Most of the following information has been taken from N0000-00-IDX-000/TMINS and is provided 
herein to acquaint the reader with the basic philosophy of the TMINS. 

b. TMINS is a 13-character alphanumeric technical manual code number.  The number is developed 
using Command, Commodity, Weapon System Designation, Subject Identifiers, Work Unit Codes, and 
acronyms.

7-11 CD-ROM NUMBERING SYSTEM FOR PDF MANUALS (See table 1).  The numbering system 
consists of a 13-position code, i.e., A1-CDFA18AD-001; 

● Positions one and two (A1) indicate a NAVAIR TM and positions three and four (CD) indicates 
this is a CD-ROM. 

● Positions one through four will always be "A1-CD." 
● Positions five through seven indicate the type of manual (i.e. F18). 
● Positions eight through ten are to be used for additional characters to describe the type of manual 

when three digits are not sufficient (i.e. F18C/D). 
● When additional characters are not required these digits will be zeros.  For instance, the first E-

2C CD-ROM would be A1-CDE2C000-001 and the first F/A18A/B/C/D CD-ROM would be A1-
CDFA18AD-001. 
● Designations for all other weapon systems peculiar TMs will use a three-position code (E2C). 
● The zero (0) is used in position five (TD) as a placeholder when not used as an identifying 

character, e.g., 0TD for Technical Directives. 
● Positions eight through ten are to be used for additional characters to describe the type of 

manual when three digits are not sufficient. 
● Positions eleven through thirteen will be in a sequence beginning at 001 and continuing, as 

required, to the highest sequence, 999. 
● A fully outfitted CTPL will have several types of TMs as indicated in positions five through ten. 

7-12 Exceptions to the above numbering system are permitted for: (1) existing technical data in digital 
format such as Electronic CAD/PAD, NA 11-100-1.1-CD.  The designator 11-100 indicates the material 
contained within is Cartridge Actuated Devices; and (2) technical data requested such as CD on Demand 
(COD). 

7-13 COD's are numbered similarly to the weapons system; positions one through four are A1-CD.  
Positions five through ten are the Unit Identification Code (UIC). 

a. Positions eleven through thirteen are an alphabetical serial code beginning with AAA for the first CD-
ROM ordered.  This 13-position code will represent this CD-ROM for as long as it is needed. 

b. Subsequent orders for the manuals there in will use the same number, even if the composition is 
revised.  The front of the CD-ROM will state that it supersedes previous issues. 

7-14 Example of CD-ROM numbering is shown in figure 5. 

8-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL STYLES 

8-2 TECHNICAL MANUALS are publications that contain instructions for the installation, operation, 
maintenance, training, and support of weapons systems, weapon system components and support 
equipment.  TM information may be presented in any form or characteristic including, but not limited to, 
hard copy, audio and visual displays, magnetic tape, discs, and other electronic devices. 

8-3 A TM normally contains operational and maintenance instructions, parts lists or parts breakdowns, 
and related technical information and procedures exclusive of administration procedures.  They are 
prepared either in the conventional or work package concept style and format.  Conventional style and 
format manuals are arranged in topic-sectionalized fashion by chapters containing sections.  Work 
package concept style and format manuals are arranged sequentially by functions and tasks within a 
function as standalone maintenance units containing all data required for specific task performance. 

8-4 COMMERCIAL MANUALS, also known as Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) manuals.  
Requirements for an acceptable commercial manual shall contain the data as established in MIL-PRF-
32216.  The manual shall precisely reflect the hardware configuration of the equipment/system.  The 
amount of data required shall be determined by the complexity of the equipment.  The manual shall 
consist of all data required for operation and maintenance of the equipment/system as determined by the 
contracting activity.

8-5 When the COTS manual is accepted, the manual shall have a cover, title page, or first page showing 
the date the manual was issued, revision designator (if applicable), the manufacturer's identification name 
and address, the equipment name, the manufacturer's model designation, serial or identification numbers 
for the equipment covered, and copyright release statement. 

9-1 CONVENTIONAL MANUAL ARRANGEMENT 

9-2 The conventional topic-sectionalized technical manual format is still being used for NAVAIR TMs.  In 
the conventional manual format, the manual is sectionalized and each section normally addresses one 
phase of maintenance related to the end item of equipment such as; Operation, Principles of Operation, 
Testing, Troubleshooting, etc.  An IPB may be contained as a section in the manual or may be developed 
as a separate manual. 

10-1  WORK PACKAGE MANUAL ARRANGEMENT 

10-2  To foster improvements in technical information, greater emphasis has been placed on data 
accessibility, adequacy, accuracy, and overall documentation usability.  The maintenance demands of 
higher technology systems resulted in a TM concept defined as a functionally assembled document, 
arranged in the general order of workflow, and grouped into small units covering individual tasks.  These 
are called Work Packages (WPs). 

10-3  WPs within the TM are defined as self-supporting units of information containing all data required for 
a technician to perform a specific task. 

10-4  WORK PACKAGE NUMBERING.  The individual WP is assigned a number that appears in the 
upper right hand corner of every page.  The WPs are numbered in their order of arrangement within the 
TM.  The WP number is a five-digit number arranged in blocks of three and two digits respectively, with 
one blank space between the third and fourth numerals i.e., 001 00. 

a. The first three digits are assigned on the initial issue of the manual.  Starting with 001, the numbers 
could progress in numerical sequence through 999. 

b. Except for WP 001, the last two digits are used when a change (or revision) to the manual is issued 
adding a new WP whose technical content logically places the WP between two existing WPs.  When this 
occurs, the new WP is numbered XXX 01.  Example:  WPs issued to be inserted between existing WPs 
008 00, 009 00, and 010 00, would be numbered 008 01 and 009 01 respectively. 

c. The only exceptions in the use of the last two digits are the assignment of WP 001 01 to the 
Numerical Index of Part Numbers and WP 001 02 to the Numerical Index of Reference Designations.  In 
special circumstances, a contractor may request an exception to the military specification from NATEC, 
for the use of the last two digits. 

11-1  APPENDICES 

11-2  An appendix is used to include material in a manual that is not a part of the normal sequence of the 
manual, such as tables, charts, etc.  Such added material becomes an integral part of the affected 
manual.  When required, appendices follow the last section of a manual.  Each appendix is identified with 
a capital letter, i.e., “Appendix A”. 

11-3  Pages, paragraphs, illustrations, and tables for appendices are numbered in Arabic numerals, 
preceded by the capital letters of the appendix, i.e., A-10 is the tenth page or paragraph in Appendix A; 
Figure B-10 is the tenth illustration in Appendix B; Table C-10 is the tenth table in Appendix C. 

11-4  Appendices will not appear in work package manuals. 

12-1  JOB PERFORMANCE AIDS 

12-2  Job Performance Aids (JPA) are multimedia or static depictions that enhance current printed and 
digital repair manuals by offering an innovative and systematic approach to display performance of a 
specific maintenance procedure.  JPAs integrate video, photographs or animations and sound in a variety 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 004 00

13 

of digital media or static format to address common mistakes and nuances that cannot be conveyed 
through the written word or traditional line-art format.  As a visually-based method of learning that 
provides for rapid comprehension by workers.  JPAs enable the capture of “real world” knowledge for 
transfer to other maintainers. 

12-3  JPA shall be used as supplemental maintenance aids, developed in such a manner that they are 
complementary, but always subordinate, to the appropriate TM.  Therefore, affected TMs shall be revised 
to reflect existence of any complementary JPAs.  Fleet use of a JPA is authorized when the TM title page 
identifies applicable JPAs.  A link to the JPA shall also be embedded in the digital PDF file of the affected 
TM.  Further, all authorized JPAs shall be posted and usable from the NATEC website 
https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/.

1-1 CONTROL OF CLASSIFIED PUBLICATIONS 

1-2 As directed in Department of the Navy Information Security Program, SECNAV M-5510.36, each 
Commanding Officer will designate a Security Manager to be responsible for the administration of the 
Information Security Program for the command. 

1-3 Each command shall publish written security procedures specifying how the requirements of 
SECNAV M-5510.36 will be accomplished within the command. 

1-4 Close coordination between the Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL) librarian and the 
command’s Security Manager is essential.  Procedures will be established for the dissemination of 
classified material originated or received by the CTPL. 

2-1 SECURITY AND CLASSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 

2-2 GENERAL.  Department of the Navy Information Security Program Regulation SECNAV M-5510.36 
provides all Department of the Navy activities and personnel with regulations and guidance for classifying 
and safeguarding classified information. 

2-3 For Weapon System/Equipment/Component technical manuals, the applicable Navy security 
classification guidance (OPNAVINST 5513.1) and/or the Contract Security Classification Specification 
(DD Form 254) are the authority for classifying technical manuals (TMs).  OPNAVINST 5513.1 and  
DD Form 254 are reviewed every 2 years and maintained current through coordination with NAVAIR 
Security (AIR-07T). 

2-4 SAFEGUARDING CLASSIFIED TECHNICAL MANUALS.  Storage, disposal, and handling of all 
classified TMs must conform to SECNAV M-5510.36 regulations.  The NAVAIR TMs described in this 
publication are prepared in accordance with classification categories for unclassified, confidential, secret, 
or top-secret security requirements.  

2-5 Classified TMs are appropriately marked and identified and must be safeguarded in accordance with 
SECNAV M-5510.36 regulations.  SECNAV M-5510.36 regulations also establish the basic policy that no 
person shall be granted access to classified information that is subject to investigation under the 
provisions of this regulation unless it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. 

2-6 IDENTIFYING SECURITY CLASSIFICATION OF TECHNICAL MANUALS is based on the 
dissemination of technical documents.  All newly created technical documents to include engineering 
drawings, standards, specifications, technical manuals, blueprints, drawings, plans, instructions, 
computer software and documentation, and other technical information that can be used or adapted for 
use to design, engineer, produce, manufacture, operate, repair, overhaul, or reproduce any military or 
space equipment or technology concerning that equipment.

2-7 Department of Defense Instruction (DODINST) 5230.24 requires the assignment of distribution 
statements to facilitate control, distribution, and release of technical documents without the need to 
repeatedly refer questions to the originating command.  The originating command may choose to make 
case-by-case exceptions to distribution limitations imposed by the statement.  Distribution statements also 
provide the extent of secondary distribution that is permissible without further authorization or approval of 
the originating command.  Distribution statement assignments are usually made by second echelon 
commands with program responsibility.  (See figure 1) 

2-8 Classified technical documents shall be assigned Distribution Statements “B,” “C,” “D,”  “E,” or “F.”  
The distribution statement assigned to a classified document shall be retained on the document after its 
declassification or until specifically changed or removed by the originating command.  Technical 
documents that are declassified and have no distribution statement assigned shall be handled as 
Distribution Statement F until changed by the originating command.  For further information on the criteria 
for which statement will be utilized, refer to SECNAV M-5510.36, Chapter 8. 

2-9 The distribution statement shall be located on the title of the manual no matter what format 
(paper/Electronic Technical Manual (ETM)/CD), followed by a “Destruction Notice” for both unclassified 
and classified media utilized in the library.  The security classification of each TM can be determined by 
viewing the technical data for that manual on the NATEC website at https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/. 

2-10 SECURITY CLASSIFICATION CHANGES in classification of TMs will be processed as rapidly as 
possible after such action is approved. 

a. These methods are used to accomplish technical manual classification change actions: 

 Letter correspondence authorizing downgrading actions. 

 Change or cancellation notices printed on title pages of TMs received.  

 Electronic messages authorizing immediate classification actions. 

b. Receipt of change notices through these methods constitutes authority for all holders of classified 
technical manuals to mark copies in accordance with the announced changes. 

2-11 PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE DECLASSIFICATION OF TECHNICAL MANUALS.  
Users shall inform the cognizant TM Logistics Element Manager (LEM) before taking local action to 
declassify TMs. 

2-12 The TM LEM will request the NAVAIR Security Office (AIR-07T) and/or the appropriate command to 
confirm the classification.  Accordingly, the cognizant TM LEM will advise the user of the proper 
classification. 

2-13 REPORTING UNSATISFACTORY SECURITY CLASSIFICATION OF TECHNICAL MANUALS.  If 
any using activity has reason to believe that security considerations fail to fully support the classification 
assigned to a specific manual, or the assigned classification is no longer applicable (downgrading 
required), the using activity should bring this issue to the attention of the activity’s Security Officer.  The 
using activity should then submit a Technical Publications Deficiency Report (TPDR), in accordance with 
the requirements described in WP 015 00. 

2-14 QUESTIONS CONCERNING CLASSIFICATION OR SECURITY OF TECHNICAL MANUALS shall 
be referred to the SECNAV M-5510.36 regulations and the using activity’s Security Officer for additional 
guidance.  Questions concerning classification or security technical manuals can also be referred to:

3-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL SUPPLEMENT 

3-2 A supplement is a subsidiary document that complements information in a manual.  It is prepared as 
specified in the basic contract or order and conforms in style and format to the requirements of the 
specifications used to prepare the basic manual. 

3-3 CLASSIFIED SUPPLEMENT.  When classified information comprises 10 percent or less of the 
manual’s contents and is concentrated in one area of the TM, the information is normally prepared as a 
classified supplement to the manual.  Such action permits the basic manual to be issued at a lower 
classification or as an unclassified manual. 

3-4 The title pages of both the basic manual and the supplement contain a cross-reference note to each 
other.  In the conventional numbering system, a classified supplement (either confidential or secret) is 
generally identified by a suffix letter, A, to the last numerical digit of the publication number.  On the other 
hand, Technical Manual Identification Numbering System (TMINS) uses a “C” for confidential and an “S” 
for secret.  

3-5 SUPPLEMENT TO DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TECHNICAL MANUALS.  Occasionally, 
elements of Department of Defense make joint use of weapon systems or equipment.  Under these 
circumstances the documents supporting the equipment are established for joint use.  However, these 
manuals are normally prepared to the specifications and support concept of the executive or procuring 
service. 

3-6 The Navy because of its unique shipboard operational environment must employ maintenance 
concepts and support criteria peculiar to its shipboard requirements.  As a result, its selection of 
maintenance actions, support equipment, and spare parts differ greatly from that of other services.  To 
support unique Navy shipboard requirements, NAVAIR procures either a separate manual or a 
supplement to an existing manual. 

3-7 The distribution statement shall be located on the title page of the manual no matter what the format 
(paper/Electronic Technical Manual (ETM)/CD) plus one or more alphabetic or numeric suffixes and the 
word “supplement” printed at the top of the title page.  The title pages of the basic and the supplement 
shall contain a cross-reference to each other. 

3-8 COMMERCIAL MANUAL SUPPLEMENT.  When a commercial manual has been approved, but 
requires additional data to make it completely adequate, a supplement will be prepared.  A supplement is 
prepared to provide additional instructions, definition of maintenance concept, illustrations, and parts list 
data including Source, Maintenance, and Recoverability (SM&R) codes.  A supplement shall be prepared 
in accordance with the technical manual general style and format requirements of military specification 
MIL-STD-38784.

1-1 DEFINITIONS OF SPECIFICATIONS AND STANDARDS 

1-2 Specification and standards are issued by the Department of Defense (DOD) to standardize material 
and equipment used within the government service.  Procuring activity will refer to a specification or 
standard in the contract when purchasing material or equipment for use by a government agency.  This 
ensures the purchased material/equipment meets the requirements of the Navy and user activity. 

a. A typical example is the procurement of a technical manual (TM). 

 Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) impose selected 
specifications in the contract. 

 These specifications stipulate the format, technical content and illustrated parts breakdown (IPB) 
requirements.  Additional specifications and standards details to be used in the TM data. 

b. Another example is that of hardware. 

 Bolts are procured in very large numbers. 

 When bolts are required, a procuring activity advertises for bids to provide X number of bolts in 
accordance with a designated specification or standard. 

 The specification or standard in turn fully describes the bolt by material to be used, bolt length, 
diameter, thread size, head size, and any other pertinent information to ensure uniformity of all 
bolts under that specification or standard number. 

2-1 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SINGLE STOCK POINT FOR MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS,

1-1 GENERAL 

1-2 The technical manual (TM) system cannot operate effectively at the user level without a definitive 
management system.  This control revolves around the technical publications library.  The aeronautical 
technical publications library serves two important logistics functions. 

● First, it provides a positive source of up-to-date information for the use of technical personnel in 
the performance of their work. 

● Second, it is the major source of reference information to facilitate personnel training and 
individual improvement. 

To properly perform these functions, the technical publications library must maintain sufficient copies of 
applicable manuals. 

1-3 COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 directs all Navy and Marine Corps Aviation activities to the contents 
of this manual for establishment of an aeronautical technical publications library.  This Work Package 
(WP) provides operating activities with sufficient detail to establish a technical publications library system. 

2-1 ESTABLISHING A TECHNICAL PUBLICATION LIBRARY 

2-2 Initial outfitting begins with an initial outfitting letter on official letterhead from an activity that is newly 
commissioned or reactivated and from existing activities transitioning to a new or different aircraft or 
missile model.  Obtaining an Initial Outfitting List (IOL) assists Central Technical Publications Library 
(CTPL) in obtaining the required publications. 

2-3 INITIAL OUTFITTING LETTER, a formal request on official letterhead for initial outfitting is mailed to:  

Director 
Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center  
ATTN:  Distribution Code 6.8.5.3.1 (IOL) 
NAS North Island, Bldg. 90 
P. O. Box 357031 
San Diego, CA  92135-7031 

a. A sample format for requesting an IOL is illustrated in figure 1. 

b. The request must include the following information: 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 007 00 
30 December 2014 

2 

(1) Specific type of IOLs requested; i.e., F-18D, S-3B, ALSS, etc. (Submit what type of IOL is 
required if activity's platform is not listed under Type Equipment Code field or submitter does not have 
access to the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) website). 

(2) Statement as to the use of NATEC Technical Publications Specialist (TPS).  This identifies for 
NATEC headquarters personnel an additional point of contact and allows the activity to coordinate with 
the TPS prior to submission of the request. 

(3) Level of maintenance for IOL requested (not required if submitter has access to the NATEC 
website). 

(4) Required date listing is needed by (not required if submitter has access to the NATEC website). 

(5) The NATEC assigned account number if known.  NATEC will assign the account number for a 
new activity. 

(6) Complete mailing address 

(7) Unit Identification Code (UIC) 

(8) Point of contact 

(9) Phone number 

(10) Email address, if applicable. 

2-4 INITIAL OUTFITTING LIST.  In Technical Manual Application System (TMAPS) Main Menu, the IOL 
function is used to generate a list of all TMs that are associated with a particular platform and 
maintenance level.  The IOL is also used to generate a commissioning based on the list for a new activity. 

2-5 On the Initial Outfitting List screen, the following search fields are displayed: Type Equipment Codes 
(i.e., Admin Pubs, ALSS, H53:CH-53E, H-60:MH-60S, etc.) and Maintenance Level (Organizational, 
Intermediate, and Depot). 

2-6 On the new Initial Outfitting List screen the following fields are displayed: Publication Number, Model, 
Series, Maintenance Level, WEB, Issue Date, Pages, Distcde (Distribution Code - A, C, D, etc.) and 
Class (Classification – U (Unclassified), S (Secret), etc.).  To view the manual, click on the WEB link of 
the desired record. 

2-7 Prior to submitting an IOL, the user is encouraged to contact the area NATEC TPS for assistance 
(WP 003 00), if required. 

2-8 The submitter downloads the selection into an Excel spreadsheet and tailors the list with the 
assistance of the respective Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) and work center supervisor (WCS).  
The quantities of each NAVAIR TM or Technical Directive (TD) required are annotated and the tailored 
IOL is then submitted as an attachment via email (preferred method) or by mail to NATEC Distribution for 
processing. 

NOTE 

TM replenishment is limited by the Naval Logistics Library (NLL) and Defense 
Automatic Addressing System Center (DAASC) web systems.  This limit is set to 
no more than three copies per UIC and supplemental address combination per 
quarter 
 
Justifiable requirements may be identified by NATEC at the time of mobilization 
of newly commissioned or reactivated units, and from existing activities 
transitioning to a new or different aircraft (WP 009 00). 

2-9 Time frames for obtaining the required manuals in a timely manner are essential.  The following 
guidelines will be used in establishing milestones: 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 007 00 
30 December 2014 

3 

a. Request for IOL shall be submitted six (6) months or at the earliest if already within this 
milestone/period, prior to receipt of the first aircraft/equipment.  The requesting activity will ensure NATEC 
has three (3) months lead time to process the tailored IOL. 

b. Use of a priority designator in accordance with WP 009 00 is appropriate.  Use of a higher priority on 
the initial outfitting requisition must be substantiated by statements containing valid reasons for the higher 
priority requirement. 

2-10 A sample format for submitting a tailored IOL without a Distribution Account Code (DAC) back to 
NATEC for a commissioning is shown in figure 2.  A sample format for submitting a tailored IOL with a 
DAC back to NATEC for a commissioning is shown in figure 3.  Remember if CTPL is transitioning from 
one platform to another enter ELMS records for the new platform which will update activity’s existing 
ADRL. 

a. Tailored IOL (must be sent in excel format to process) and completed letter (may be sent as a PDF 
format) may be returned to NATEC via email (nani_customerservice@navy.mil) and the original IOL and 
official signed letter by mail. 

b. The letter must include the following information: 

 Specific type of IOLs submitted; i.e., F-18D, E-2D, ALSS, etc. as an enclosure or attachment. 

 Statement as to the use of NATEC TPS.  This identifies for NATEC headquarters personnel an 
additional point of contact and allows the activity to coordinate with the TPS prior to submission of 
the request. 

 UIC as listed in the Navy Comptroller Manual, Volume II, Chapter 5. 

 Priority designator as determined in accordance with the requirements in WP 009 00. 

 Required delivery date for manuals. 

 The NATEC assigned account number if known. 

NATEC will assign the account number for a new activity. 

2-11 Upon receipt of tailored IOL, NATEC submits requisitions for warehouse publications to NAVSUP for 
appropriate supply action, submits printing request to Defense Logistics Agency Document Services 
(DLADS) for printable publications and creates non-paper media for publications digital copies.  NATEC 
updates the activity's Automatic Distribution Requirements List (ADRL) database for non-ELMS users.  
The activity will receive files indicating the following information: 

● Document numbers used for the commissioning. 
● NAVAIR numbers that cannot be identified. 
● NAVAIR numbers that are cancelled. 
● NAVAIR numbers that are number assignments only. 
● NAVAIR numbers that are restricted issue. 

2-12 CTPL librarian will note discrepancies in the NATEC Enhanced Library Management System (ELMS) 
Program, if applicable.  CTPL librarian must enter a record into TMAPS ELMS Program database for 
each copy of a NAVAIR manual and or Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) requested.  An 
ADRL file to NATEC Distribution is not required for ELMS users. 

2-13 Once the received manuals have been recorded, filed and distributed, it is mandatory that a 
complete requirements analysis be conducted. 

2-14 Aircraft Manuals Indexes should be screened to identify possible new requirements and all activity 
publication users consulted to determine total requirements of manuals. 

3-1 AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS 

3-2 Automatic Distribution Requirements are those manuals an activity requires NATEC to distribute 
automatically when revisions or changes are released or when new manuals are created and distributed 
affecting equipment the activity is supporting.  An ADRL file must be submitted to NATEC Distribution  

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 007 00 
30 December 2014 

4 

whenever automatic distribution requirements change, or submitted at least annually.  ELMS users are 
excluded from this requirement. 

3-3 The CTPL librarian shall maintain an accurate ADRL for all manuals used by their unit.  The ADRL 
must include all manuals required regardless of media or whether acquired via NATEC website, Joint 
Knowledge Caching Server (JKCS), CD-ROM, or in paper format. 

3-4 NATEC will acknowledge receipt of new distribution requirements by email or letter depending on the 
method by which it was received.  If no response is received by the activity within 30 days after 
submission, send follow-up by letter, message, email to nani_customerservice@navy.mil, or FAX to 
(619)545-2722 (DSN 735-2722) to NATEC requesting status of ADRL file receipt.  

3-5 AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR ENHANCED LIBRARY MANAGEMENT 
SYSTEM USERS of NAVAIR media is contained in WP 010 00.  ADRL for TMAPS ELMS users are 
submitted automatically via the ELMS Program each time the quantities are adjusted.  TMAPS ELMS 
users will utilize the "Library Audit" feature in the program. 

3-6 AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-ENHANCED LIBRARY 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USERS.  Figure 4 shows a sample letter format for a customer requesting a 
copy of their ADRL. Once received, update and resubmit back to NATEC.  Upon NATEC receipt of the 
ADRL from an activity, it will normally take a few days for the new requirements to take effect.  However, 
receipts by the activity may not be visible for at least 90 days, based on the requirements submitted and 
updating of the manuals. 

3-7 NATEC personnel will upload the activity’s ADRL file into a master distribution file.  Once an activity’s 
ADRL has been entered, all future manual updates will be automatically distributed by NATEC through a 
mailing label system. 

3-8 Contractors who elect to go on automatic distribution for manuals should be aware that they will be 
charged, and verification of contract will be required in writing from the defense command that entered 
into or manages the contract.  These accounts start with “CX” and are receiving automatic distribution of 
technical manuals which they are required in support of their government contract with the United States 
but are provided at cost (Non-Government Furnished Material).  These accounts would not have online 
access and are not covered by ELMS. 

a. For more information concerning cost of manuals, contractors can contact NATEC by letter or FAX at 
Commercial (619)545-2722 (DSN 735-2722) or by email to nani_customerservice@navy.mil. 

b. Contractors who are not authorized to be on automatic distribution for NAVAIR publications media 
may purchase from NATEC Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)/Government/Industry Sales Branch by 
letter or FAX at Commercial (619)545-2722 (DSN 735-2722) or by email to 
nani_qualifiedcontractor@navy.mil. 

c. Contractors are not authorized to requisition NAVAIR manuals media from the 
nani_qualifiedcontractor@navy.mil supply system. 

3-9 AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS LIST, OBTAINING CURRENT COPY.  The ADRL 
is the activity’s automatic distribution requirements on the NATEC master distribution file.  A copy of the 
activity’s ADRL is available on the NATEC website for review if the activity is receiving questionable 
documentation, i.e., receipt of wrong quantities of manuals from the automatic distribution system. 

3-10 Letters, email, or telephone calls requesting a copy of the activity’s ADRL is accepted by NATEC.  
Upon receipt of a returned ADRL from NATEC or downloading the file from the NATEC website, an 
activity should compare the listing with their activity's database.  This process will identify any 
discrepancies between the desired quantities as entered in the activity's database and what NATEC 
carries in the master distribution file. 

3-11 If changes are needed or errors are found, activities must submit corrections utilizing the ADRL 
function identified in WP 010 00 or by making the appropriate changes on their customer account on the 
NATEC website.  Activities whose libraries contain more than 30 manuals are required to submit ADRLs 
annually to NATEC.  ADRLs must also be submitted when requirements change. 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 007 00 
30 December 2014 

5 

3-12 Activities with 30 or less NAVAIR manuals should submit a formal letter to NATEC to update their 
automatic distribution requirements along with a point of contact.  An alternative to submitting an ADRL 
annually is to update your automatic distribution requirements directly on the NATEC website.  Updating 
your requirements on the NATEC website satisfies the annual requirement to submit an ADRL file. 

3-13 Activities must place their actual requirements on their ADRLs to ensure receipt of required 
quantities.  This includes requirements for electronic as well as paper manuals.  When the requirement 
for a publication is for electronic format only then the pub type in the ELMS Program must be "E" vice "N".  
This will eliminate the distribution of excess paper manuals. 

4-1 AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTION MAILING LABEL  

4-2 See figure 5 for an example of a mailing label.  An understanding of the mailing label format is 
essential for library personnel.  With this knowledge, obvious errors can be detected and corrective action 
taken.  The mailing label format is as follows: 

● NAVAIR TECHNICAL MANUAL NUMBER.  Allows quick comparison of mailing label to contents 
of envelope. 

● NATEC ASSIGNED ACCOUNT NUMBER.  Consists of the activity’s Standard Navy Distribution 
List (SNDL) number and a sequential number assigned by NATEC to identify individual activities. 

● ADRL QUANTITY SHIPPED.  Identifies quantity enclosed, and should correspond to activity 
ADRL requirements. 

● TECHNICAL MANUAL STOCK NUMBER.  The stock number of the manual enclosed. 

5-1 PUSHED PUBLICATIONS 

5-2 As new equipment/weapons systems are developed and procured by NAVAIR, the manuals are 
sometimes “PUSHED” to the user by NATEC based on the type equipment codes (TEC) submitted on 
your ADRL file as cited in WP 010 00.  The user must be able to readily identify these PUSH manuals 
and determine if the manuals are, in fact, required and quantities are sufficient. 

5-3 If these PUSH manuals are determined to be required and the quantities require modification, then 
the user must submit an update to the ADRL.  Note that PUSH manuals are not automatically added to 
an activity’s ADRL. 

5-4 Prior to discarding the label from received manuals, the user should review the label with the ELMS 
database.  If the publication is not in the ELMS, the publication could be one that was PUSHED to you 
based on the equipment codes you selected on your ADRL submission. 

6-1 AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTION ERRORS 

6-2 When errors in the automatic distribution system are encountered, the following action should be 
taken: 

● The cognizant NATEC TPS should be contacted for assistance.  Most often, the problem can be 
resolved with the assistance of the TPS (WP 003 00). 

● If the problem cannot be resolved, a letter or email should be sent or telephone call made to 
NATEC. 

6-3 Disposition of material received in excess shall be in accordance with the instructions contained in 
WP 009 00, Disposition of Excess Publications. 

7-1 TERMINATION OF AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS 

7-2 When an activity no longer has requirements for automatic distribution of NAVAIR publications 
media, a letter requesting cancellation will be submitted to NATEC 120 days prior to the deactivation date 
(i.e., decommissioning date) and discontinue sending ADRL files to NATEC.  Once the customer 
terminates automatic distribution requirements, the DAC is transferred to history in TMAPs and manuals 
from that date of receipt on will not be sent.

NOTE 

If the account needs reactivation, submit a formal letter to NATEC and include a 
statement to reactivate the ELMS account.  Once the account is reactivated, submit 
for ELMS permission for that account through Customer Service Support Desk.  All 
records in the reactivated account will be re-entered into the database by the 
requestor. 

7-3 A sample letter for terminating an ADRL DAC is contained in Figure 6. 

8-1 CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY LIBRARIAN REQUIRED DIRECTIVES, 
MANUALS AND DOCUMENTS 

8-2 The CTPL librarian requires specific directives and manuals to assist in setting up and operating a 
library.  WP 013 00, figure 10 shows the minimum requirements.  Activities are encouraged to increase 
their files as necessary to properly support maintenance of assigned weapons system/equipment.  These 
may be maintained in paper or digital format.  Cross reference to appropriate URL is also authorized. 

9-1 TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY INFORMATION SHEETS  

9-2 In addition to special editions, the Technical Publication Library Information Sheet (TPLIS) will now 
be released bi-annually, in June and November.  The TPLIS provides CTPL librarians with significant 
events in CTPL management and the latest NAVAIR policy and articles as it relates to NAVAIR 
publications and TDs.  CTPL librarians are encouraged to submit their ideas, suggestions, comments and 
recommendations for TPLIS articles to nani_customerservice@navy.mil.  The TPLIS is located on 
NATEC's website.

1-1 NAVAL AERONAUTICAL PUBLICATIONS CROSS REFERENCE 

1-2 The Naval Aeronautical Publications Cross Reference consists of four distinct parts as follows: 

● The Naval Supply (NAVSUP) System Command Naval Logistics Library (NLL) (P2003) which is 
available on NAVSUP website https://nll2.ahf.nmci.navy.mil/. 

● NATEC website “Document Content Search” (repairable end item part number (P/N) to manual). 
● NAVAIR 01-700, Airborne Weapons/Stores Publication Index (Portable Document File (PDF) 

only). 
● NAVAIR 01-XXXX-0, OR A1-XXXX-AML-000, Aircraft Manual List (AML). 

2-1 NAVAL SUPPLY SYSTEM COMMAND NAVAL LOGISTICS LIBRARY  

2-2 This is a research site for all Navy technical manuals (TMs), NAVAIR technical directives (TDs), 
directives and other digital documents hosted by Naval Supply System Command at Mechanicsburg, PA.  
This cross reference site is maintained based on information inputs provided by the individual systems 
commands.  It identifies what items are stocked and available for issue.  This cross reference site should 
not be used to determine if a NAVAIR publication has been cancelled. 

2-3 Research to identify status of NAVAIR technical documentation should be directed to Customer 
Service: 1-877-418-6824 (available 24/7 for requisition status) or when submitting email to Global 
Distance Support Center (GDSC) (enter NLL on Subject line.), gdsc@navy.mil. 

2-4 At the NLL website, if researching for other sponsor’s publications, forms or tools click the "Links" tab 
on the screen and select the appropriate sponsor’s "Restricted Access" to locate/research site. 

3-1 NAVAL AIR TECHNICAL DATA AND ENGINEERING SERVICE CENTER WEBSITE (DOCUMENT 
CONTENT SEARCH) 

3-2 On the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) website, under Technical 
Manual Application System (TMAPS), the "Document Content Search" function is for locating NAVAIR 
manuals for repairable components.  This feature replaced the NA 00-500A and has been added as a 
quick search.  The search provides 100 records maximum listing per component or part number. 

4-1 NAVAIR 01-700 AIRBORNE WEAPONS/STORES MANUALS/CHECKLISTS PUBLICATION 
INDEX 

4-2 This cross reference manual is designed to provide using activities with a current guide to ensure 
that all existing changes/revisions have been incorporated in aircraft conventional weapon loading, 
release and control, Armament Weapons Support Equipment (AWSE), and weapon assembly/ 
disassembly checklists and manuals on hand and that these manuals are the most recent available.

4-3 The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 685100D/PST 32080, China Lake, CA 
93555-6106, serves as an information clearing house for U.S. Navy activities on airborne weapons, 
stores, and related items.  Questions, concerns, suggestions, comments, or data can be resolved by 
calling the Ordnance Technical Hotline at DSN 437-4501 or commercial (760)939-4501. 

4-4 Previously, changes/revisions/Rapid Action Changes (RACs)/Interim Rapid Action Changes (IRACs) 
to these TMs and checklists were printed and distributed quarterly in the 01-700.  These changes are now 
posted monthly on the NATEC website.  This process ensures that the Fleet/customer always receives 
current information in a timely manner.  This manual is posted on the NATEC website 
(https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/) and may be viewed and/or downloaded as desired. 

4-5 Non-deploying activities are encouraged to use the NA 01-700 from the Joint Knowledge Caching 
Server (JKCS) or NATEC website to reduce delays in receiving updates.  Errors identified in this index 
should be submitted via the Technical Publications Deficiency Report (TPDR) Program (WP 015 00).  

5-1 NAVAIR 01-XXXX-0, OR A1-XXXX-AML-000, AIRCRAFT MANUAL LIST 

5-2 Aids the fleet/customer in identifying the manual applicable to a peculiar type aircraft, associated 
systems, repairable components and support equipment.  This manual may also be used to prepare 
allowance lists, determine automatic distribution requirements, and to investigate, or select the types of 
coverage available at different maintenance levels. 

5-3 When locating your peculiar aircraft listing, some of the titles to use when researching in Technical 
Manual Application System (TMAPS) are Applicable Technical Manuals, List of Applicable Publications, 
Technical Manual List, Aircraft Manual List or Technical Documentation List.

1-2 This work package describes procedures to be used by Naval activities and other Department of 
Defense (DOD) Organizations requiring technical manuals (TMs) or technical directives (TDs) that are 
under the management cognizance of the Naval Air Systems Command (NASC).  Additional information 
is provided to assist in procurement of manuals issued by the Naval Supply System and directives issued 
by the offices of the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) and the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV). 

1-3 The NASC Publications distribution program is built around a computerized automatic “push to user” 
system where the user establishes the requirements.  However, due to changes in requirements or other 
extenuating circumstances, it sometimes becomes necessary to submit single action, or one-time 
requests, through the “pull” process.

4-1 ORDERING PROCEDURES 

4-2 DD FORM 1348 is the Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures/Military Standard 
Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures (MILSTRIP/MILSTRAP) requisition form used 
throughout the Navy supply system.  These procedures are used to initiate a one-time (supply action) 
request for NAVAIRSYSCOM TMs, TDs and departmental directives.  Also, activities use this form for 
submitting requisitions with exception data (i.e. no stock number).  Complete instructions for use of DD 
Form 1348 are contained in NAVSUP PUBs 409, and 485. 

4-3 DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY TRANSACTION SERVICE is the method of submitting 
MILSTRIP/MILSTRAP requisitions.  NAVSUP Pub 485 contains detailed guidance on the use of Defense 
Logistics Agency (DLA).  NAVSUP Pub 409 provides the information on the codes used with the Defense 
Logistics Agency (DLA). 

4-4 Defense Logistics Agency Requisition Transmission 

a. WEB Requisitioning (WEBREQ) is a Transaction Services Web product that provides customers a 
means to input materiel requisitions, cancellations, follow-ups, modifications, and Material Obligation 
Validation (MOV) documents.  WEBREQ also provides status and response documents back to the user.  
Requisitions submitted via WEBREQ reach Defense Automated Addressing System Center (DAASC) 
almost immediately.  The requisitioner can either order publications by entering individual records 
following the format of the DD FORM 1348. 

b. An User ID and Password from DLA must be obtained before requisitioners can use the WEBREQ.  
The procedures are explained on the DLA Home Page, 
https://www.transctionservices.dla.mil/daashome/webreq.asp.  Requisitioners can also check the status of 
publications requisitions and receive assistance with ordering by calling Weapons Systems Support 
Philadelphia Publications Directorate NLL Customer Service Desk at DSN 442-2626, Commercial 
(215)697-2626, or toll-free telephone 1-866-817-3130. 

c. Additional DLA programs available to activities are: 

DIELOG.  Defense Automated Addressing System (DAAS) Integrated E-mail Logistics System 
DAMES.  DAAS Automated Message Exchange System 
DARS.  DAAS AUTODIN Replacement System 
DDN.  Defense Data Network 

d. Additional information and assistance with these programs can be obtained from the DLA web page, 
https://www.transactionservices.dla.mil/daashome/webreq.asp. 

4-5 NAVAL LOGISTICS LIBRARY P2003 Online Search, Order, and Status Tool via the Internet is an 
additional manual ordering option provided by NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (WSS) Operations 
Directorate (03).  The Naval Logistics Library (NLL) P2003, accessed at https://nll2.ahf.nmci.navy.mil/ 
provides complete supply support, including requisition validation, and status information for customers 
using either method.   Also it’s the location for digital NAVSUP directives and publications. 

4-6 Requisitioners can also check the status of manuals by calling the NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia NLL 
Customer Service Desk at DSN 442-2626, Commercial (215)697-2626, or toll-free telephone 1-866-817-
3130. 

4-7 REQUISITION FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES.  If an activity has not received any communication, 
i.e., status from WSS-Philadelphia, concerning its requisitions for manuals within 45 days of the original 
request for Continental United States (CONUS) based activities and 60 days for activities based outside 
of CONUS, they should follow-up on the requisition. 

4-8 Follow-up on requisitions submitted either via DAAS or “on-line” when utilizing ELMS requisition log.  
The status of any requisition for the unit may also be checked on the NLL P2003 Online Search, Order, 
and Status Tool via the Internet.  If using a paper log, print a copy of the requisition status and maintain 
with the original requisition or annotate follow-up date and status if using an electronic requisition log.

Reordering without researching the current status of the initial requisition will cause duplicate publications 
to be received by the requester. 

4-9 EXPLANATION OF “STATUS” FROM NAVSUP WEAPONS SUPPORT SERVICE 
PHILADELPHIA PUBLICATIONS DIRECTORATE.  Refer to the NAVSUP PUB 409 and NAVSUP PUB 
485 for explanation of the status received.  Depending upon code selected, NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia 
will notify the requisitioning activity and/or the ship-to activity of the status of its requisition. 

4-10 Customers can also obtain status of their requisitions by obtaining a “USERID” and password for an 
account with DAASC named WEBVLIPS.  The information for this account is available from 
https://www.transactionservices.dla.mil/daashome/homepage.asp.  Assistance may also be obtained from 
a Technical Publication Specialist (TPS).  

4-11 Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL) librarian must have a basic understanding of how to 
review status information on manual requisitions.  For more specific answers to problems encountered 
with requisitions, refer to your local Supply Customer Service Facility or the cognizant NATEC Technical 
Publication Specials (TPS) (WP 003 00). 

4-12 REQUISITION FILE.  A local requisition log must be available to track the progress of documents in 
the supply process.  The minimum requirements for the log are: 

a. Julian date 

b. Serial number 

c. Stock Number 

d. Quantity 

e. Work Center for which ordered 

f. Status with date assigned 

g. Date received 

h. Remarks include Follow-up if sent. 

i. Additional columns may be added if desired.  The form needs to meet the requirements of the user.  
Contact the TPS for assistance in establishing and maintaining the appropriate records of accountability 
for the requisitions. 

j. Each CTPL librarian is responsible for ordering manuals and will maintain a local requisition log.  If 
the NAVSUP NLL website is used to submit requisitions, the website will return to the CTPL librarian a 
confirmation e-mail.  This information should be entered into the Requisition log, showing the status.  
Locally generated requisition logs may be discarded when the Requisition procedure in the ELMS 
Program is used.  Status reports may be discarded when the information has been entered into either the 
locally generated Requisition log or the ELMS program database. 

5-1 THREE COPIES LIMITATION FOR PRINT ON DEMAND PRINTING 

5-2 Fleet and other NAVAIR customers when requisitioning print on demand (POD) will receive a 
quantity restriction of three copies per unit identification code (UIC) and supplemental address 
combination per quarter on secondary printing requirements. 

5-3 Exceptions to the three-copy limitations are requisitions initiated for; Hot Ships, cash sales, Foreign 
Military Sales (FMS) requisitions, and Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization 
(NATOPS) requests routed via the Logistics Element Manager (LEM), and other justifiable requirements 
identified by COMNAVAIRFOR and TYCOMs via NATEC at the time of mobilization.   

5-4 Justifiable requirements may also be identified by COMNAVAIRFOR and TYCOMs via NATEC at the

10-1 DISPOSITION OF EXCESS MANUALS 

10-2 The cost of postage and the cost of restocking are such that in most cases the manuals that are in 
excess of the activity’s requirements will be disposed of locally.  Manuals may be passed to any other 
Navy or Marine Corps activity requiring the manuals. 

10-3 DESTRUCTION OF PAPER UNCLASSIFIED TECHNICAL MANUALS.  Although most TMs are 
unclassified, they are utilized as operational manuals and should not be disposed of in the trash. 

a. Some options are: 

 Large strip (1/2 inch) shredding, 

 Pit burning, 

 Recycling into pulp at a commercial facility (positive military control must be maintained), 

 Hand tear (or machine cut) each page into quarters.  Maintain quarter page separation with 
bagging and place out for local refuse pickup.  Ensure bags are left for pickup on alternating 
days. 

NOTE 

Ensure the Local Commanding Officer’s instructions are followed in selecting one or 
more of the above destruction procedures. 

b. Classified material.  Dispose of as set forth in SECNAV M-5510.36. 

10-4 DISPOSITION OF NAVAIR TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS BINDERS.  Check with other activities in 
your area to see if they are in need of binder(s). 

10-5 DISPOSITION OF UNCLASSIFIED CD-ROMs.  If your local Automated Data Processing (ADP) has 
established a disposal program, comply with their procedures.  For unclassified, limited documents, 
destroy by any method that will prevent disclosure of contents or reconstruction of the documents.  
Disposal of plastic CD-ROM discs at sea shall be per OPNAVINST 5090.1. 

11-1 FORCE/ACTIVITY DESIGNATOR 

11-2 The issue priority code system is established to ensure that requirements are processed in 
accordance with the importance of the mission of the requesting activity and the urgency of need.  The 
provisions of this system are applicable to all requisitioners authorized to request supply support from and 
within any military supply distribution system.  This system establishes criteria for both the requisitioner 
and the distribution system. 

11-3 The Force/Activity Designator (F/AD) and the Urgency of Need Designator (UND), although not 
directly applied to requisitions, are the governing factors needed to determine the Issue Priority Code 
which is applied directly to requisitions.  A general background of the requirements for assigning these 
priority codes is provided below to afford a more thorough understanding of the issue priority code 
system.  Refer to OPNAVINST 4614.1 for complete coverage. 

11-4 A F/AD (Roman numerals I through V) is assigned by the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, the Department of Defense (DOD) staff, or individual DOD components to indicate the mission 
essential of the unit, organization, installation, project, or program to meet national objectives.  The F/AD, 
combined with the Urgency of Need Designator (UND) Code (an alphabetic character), selected by the 
requiring activity, determines the priority designator.  This designator expresses the basic military urgency 
for material movement and issue transactions.  The Force/Activity (F/A) consists of the following: 

a. A unit, organization, or installation performing a specific function or mission. 

b. A body of troops, ships, aircraft, or a combination thereof. 

c. A function, mission, project or program including those under military assistance (grant aid and/or 
sales). 

d. The FAD is assigned in accordance with the mission essentially as follows: 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 009 00 
30 December 2014 

8 

 Primarily assigned only on combat conditions.  This designator is assigned, however, during 
special peacetime missions, such as top national priority or declared emergencies. 

 Designator II.  Primarily assigned for combat ready forces maintained to deploy within 24 hours. 

 Designator III.  Primarily assigned to combat ready forces maintained to deploy within 30 days in 
support of those covered in Designator II. 

 Designator IV.  Primarily assigned to combat ready forces maintained to deploy within 30 to 90 
days. 

 Designator V.  Assigned to all other activities, including administrative/staff units not covered in 
Designators I through IV. 

12-1 URGENCY OF NEED DESIGNATOR  

12-2 The UND is assigned in relationship to the function or mission performed by the activity.  These 
designators (letters A through C) are assigned primarily as shown in table 1 and as follows: 

a. Designator A:  Assigned for emergency and immediate requirements for non-available material 
without which the force/activity concerned is unable to perform mission or tasks.  Assigned for material 
required to eliminate existing work stoppage. 

b. Designator B:  Assigned for immediate/urgent requirements for non-available material without which 
impairs the capability of the force/activity concerned or the operational capability of aircraft/ equipment.  
Missions can be performed but with decreased operational effectiveness and efficiency. 

c. Designator C:  Assigned for material requirements for initial outfitting and filling allowances, 
scheduled maintenance, routine stock, repair or maintenance of supply support and stocks not 
immediately required. 

13-1 PRIORITY DESIGNATOR 

13-2 Combining the assigned F/AD and the appropriate UND will enable the requisitioner to determine the 
appropriate Priority Designator.  It should be noted that an assigned F/AD normally limits the requisitioner 
to choosing from three priority designators consistent with the UND.  Table 1 will provide the user with a 
method of determining the right priority.

14-1 DISTRIBUTION PROCESS REQUIRED FOR TECHNICAL MANUALS REQUIRED BY NAVSEA 
AIR CAPABLE SHIPS AND SHORE STATIONS 

14-2 DISTRIBUTION PROCESS for technical manuals required by air capable ships and shore stations: 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 009 00 
30 December 2014 

9 

a. In August 2009, the Naval Aviation Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) and 
the Naval Systems Data Support Activity (NSDSA) established web services from NAVAIR/NATEC’s 
TMAPS to NAVSEA’s Technical Data Management Information System (TDMIS) in order to electronically 
distribute specific NAVAIR technical manuals to NAVSEA air capable ships (AS, CG, DDG, FFG, LCC, 
LPD, LSD, T-AE, T-AFS, T-AH, T-AK, T-AKE, T-AO, T-AOE, T-ARS, T-ATF, T-AVB).  CVNs, LHAs and 
LHDs receive NAVAIR technical manuals through the NAVAIR distribution process.  NAVSEA shore 
stations can access technical manuals through TDMIS.  A memorandum of agreement between NSDSA 
and NAVAIR 6.8.5 establishing responsibilities was signed on August 5, 2009. 

b. The following programs have TMs identified for web services: H-60 Organizational & Intermediate 
(O&I), H-53 O & I, General Series, Mobile Equipment, ALSS, Aircraft Launch & Recovery Equipment 
(ALRE), Air Traffic Control (ATC), Common Electronics, Ship Weapons Installations Manuals (SWIM) and 
Shop Test Equipment (STE). 

c. NAVAIR Technical Data LEM approval is required before a TM will be considered for web services 
between TMAPS and TDMIS. 

14-3 UPDATING A TECHNICAL MANUAL.  Technical manual updates will follow the normal initial 
distribution for NAVAIR technical manuals.  However, if a manual is identified for web services to TDMIS, 
the metadata and PDF copy of the technical manual will be sent to TDMIS the same day it is posted to 
TMAPS.  If a technical manual is designated as digital only distribution, i.e. ALSS, it will not be available 
in paper through NLL.  

14-4 CANCELLATION PROCEDURE.  If a technical manual identified for web services is cancelled, the 
NAVAIR LEM must notify the NATEC distribution team and Naval Systems Data Support Activity 
(NSDSA) to pull the technical manual from TDMIS and TMAPS. 

14-5 ADDING A NEW MANUAL PROCEDURE.  NAVSEA organizations shall send the NATEC Help 
Desk a request by logging onto the TMAPS website at https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/ to add technical 
manuals to web services if they require a new NAVAIR technical manual.  NAVSEA TMAPS accounts 
other than LHAs, LHDs and CVNs will not be maintained.

1-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL APPLICATION SYSTEM ENHANCED LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
OVERVIEW 

1-2 The Enhanced Library Management System (ELMS) is the only automated system authorized for 
use in managing Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL) technical data.  ELMS provides on-line, 
real-time updates to the technical library.  

1-3 Use of the ELMS is required for all activities requiring automatic distribution of more than 30 NAVAIR 
maintenance technical manuals (TMs).  Non-ELMS users are known as those activities requiring 30 or 
less manuals.  To be placed on automatic distribution, submit a letter to Naval Air Technical Data and 
Engineering Service Center (NATEC) listing their TM requirements, including quantities.  Non-ELMS 
users authorized NATEC website access shall update automatic distribution in accordance with 
paragraph 7-1 of this work package. If a customer is not authorized access to the NATEC website 
automatic distribution requirements must be submitted by a letter annually. 

1-4 Technical Manual Application System (TMAPS) ELMS provides users with an on-line, centralized, 
accurate and verifiable database for TMs and Portable Electronic Maintenance Aids (PEMA).  A record in 
ELMS will be used to control all publications, including partial publications, and media containing 
technical publications managed by CTPL. 

a. Access to TMAPS ELMS is achieved through the NATEC website (https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/).  
A user must register with NATEC in order to log into the system with “read only” capability.  See WP 013 
00 for further guidelines to access the NATEC website.  For permissions needed to update and manage 
database functions, additional ELMS permissions must be granted.  Submit on the NATEC website 
through Customer Service Support Desk or send an email to nani_customerservice@navy.mil and 
provide the following information at a minimum; Activity’s Distribution Account Code (DAC) and 
requestor’s Username ID (this is located on the “myNATEC Technical Data Website Homepage” under 
“myNATEC Account Information” or “My User Account”).  Provide any additional information to assist 
NATEC in expediting request (WP 013 00, paragraph 2-1c provides further guidelines). 

b. To view activity’s ELMS account, once you access the NATEC website homepage select “Enhanced 
Library Management System (ELMS)” under the header “myNATEC Links”.  If customer is in any section 
of the website and cannot locate “Enhanced Library Management System (ELMS)” click on TMAPS, and 
locate the ELMS link to activate the ELMS Program. 

1-5 All reproduced paper copies will be managed in the same manner as the original manual by entering 
them into Technical Manual Application System (TMAPS) ELMS and affixing appropriate library stamps. 

a. The copy held by the dispersed library must, as a minimum, be comprised of: the “Title Page,” all 
referenced material, all of the “Numerical Index of Effective Work Packages/Pages,” and the work 
packages or pages desired by the Work Center Supervisor (WCS). 

 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 010 00

b. A copy number will be assigned and in the “Remarks” field of TMAPS ELMS record will be annotated 
with: “This manual consists of the Title page, Numerical Index pages XXXX, and Work Packages XXX 
XX, pages XXX to XXX.  This is a complete manual for audit purpose the remainder of this manual is 
maintained on the NATEC website, Joint Technical Data Information (JTDI), or CD-ROM maintained by 
the activity.”  (WP 011 00 paragraph 7-1) 

c. Control of non-routine reproduced portions of the TM when the CTPL is not available is as follows: 

- A Quality Assurance (QA) Subject Matter Expert (SME) shall review all printed material for 
completeness and ensure proper control. 

- Identify the reproduced TM in the corrective action block of the digital Visual Information Display 
System/Maintenance Action Form (VIDS/MAF) in Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management 
Information System (NALCOMIS) (OPNAV 4790/60) or work order by annotating the TM number and 
specific pages that were printed.  Example: NA 01-1A-35, dtd 01 Aug 05, pgs 1-1 thru 1-10, total of 15 
pgs. 

- The WCS shall ensure that all printed material is accounted for and destroyed upon completion of a 
maintenance action per procedures outlined in the NA 00-25-100.  The supervisor’s signature on the 
digital VIDS/MAF or work order indicates the printed material is certified current, accounted for, and 
destroyed per requirements. (WP 011 00)

3-12 Status Explanation 

When auditing the ELMS database the status codes provides information pertaining to the status of the 
TM identified in ELMS as it compares to NATEC TMAPS record.  The following explanations explain 
some of the different combinations (see table 2): 

a.  (Cancelled Manual) – Removal of the TM from the TMAPS repository.  If TM is still required, refer 
to WP 013 00 paragraph 18-1 on criteria and managing cancelled TMs in ELMS. 

b.  (Outdated Manual) – TMAPS has a newer released information against manual.  

c.  (Pushed Manual) – A Yellow “D” appears in the status block when a notice, change, pickup 
revision, revision or new manual, whether in paper or CD, is pushed to the user during the initial 
distribution.  Also, if an activity has the manual identified as Pub Type “N” or “I” in their ELMS database a 
yellow “D” will appear identify that a new publication or an update is posted to the NATEC website.  

(1) Once the new or updated manual is posted on the NATEC website the yellow “D” stays in effect 
for 60 days or upon receipt by the user. 

(2) If not received within 60 days from the posted date on the NATEC website, the yellow “D” turns 

into a red “D” (  ).  If received and identified as received in ELMS, the status icon turns into the PDF 

symbol (  ). 

(3) Reprints, IRACs and ICs will not generate a yellow “D”. 

d.  - (ELMS’ has more current information) – Sometimes upon receipt of a TM an activity may have 
the most up-to-date information.  If this does not change to the PDF icon within three days, notify NATEC 
through nani_customerservice@navy.mil of the discrepancy. 

3-13 CUSTOMER ACCOUNT (TMAPS) (figure 8).  Click on the “Customer Account (TMAPS)” option to 
manage account profile information.  The option redirects you to the “TMAPS Customer Account Update

submit, and under “ADRL Update: (WEB)” your name will be displayed showing the user and date the 
ADRL was updated.  This will take care of the yearly update requirement. 

c. This is also one of the two places to update information (mailing address, primary librarian name and 
email account, etc.).  The other screen is the “My User Account”. 

8-1 REVIEWING RECEIPT OF MANUAL/CD/DVD FROM ADRL DISTRIBUTION 

8-2 If a manual or CD/DVD is received and is not listed on the ADRL, the CTPL will determine if it is 
required and if the quantity is sufficient.  If the manual or CD/DVD is required and not listed or the quantity 
is incorrect, the ADRL Account should be updated by entering the manual or CD/DVD information into 
activity’s ELMS database (ELMS users) or adding to “ADRL Listing” (NON-ELMS users) .  By updating 
the ADRL with any new (PUSHED) publication or CD/DVD, the user will be placed on distribution for 
future updates. 

8-3 As each piece of official mail is received, the following shall be accomplished: 

a. Verify that the contents of the package agree with the label (WP 007 00, figure 5).  If contents 
disagree with the label, send original label (or photo-static copy) with what was actually received (i.e., 
manual number and quantity received) to: 

Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center 
ATTN: Distribution Branch, Code 6.8.5.3.1 
NAS North Island, Bldg. 90 
PO Box 357031 
San Diego, CA 92135-7031 
 

b. The correct material will be shipped to the activity without further action.

NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND 
TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 

 
ELECTRONIC AND INTERACTIVE ELECTRONIC TECHNICAL MANUAL 

Reference Material 

Central/Dispersed Technical Publications Library Operating Procedures .................................... WP 013 00 

1-1 OVERVIEW 

1-2 Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) is responsible for defining and 
enforcing all policies relative to the creation, storage, and distribution of digital technical data for NAVAIR.  
The driving force behind NAVAIR technical data policy is to ensure standardization, ease of use by the 
fleet maintainers, and the economical, fast and efficient delivery of technical data to the fleet. 

1-3 This work package provides guidance for utilizing electronic versions of NAVAIR technical manuals 
(TMs).  NATEC will distribute all TMs in paper, Compact Disc-Read Only Memory(s) [CD-ROM(s)], or any 
other digital format which includes Interactive Electronic Technical Manual(s) [IETM(s)].  NAVAIR does 
not authorize nor does it direct anyone to eliminate paper manuals unless activities have all required 
infrastructure, including storage and access, availability and sustainment of Portable Electronic 
Maintenance Aids (PEMAs), and the demonstrated ability to use electronic media to perform the full 
range of maintenance actions as directed by the appropriate Type Commander (TYCOM).  Refer all 
requests via TYPEWING or Marine Air Wing (MAW) with final approval of any deviation request to 
applicable TYCOM. 

1-4 Electronic versions of NAVAIR TMs are authorized for use by fleet maintainers when distributed 
and/or accessed by authorized personnel via the following authorized sources by priority: 

a. NAVAIR TM website, maintained by NATEC, is authorized for use.  This website provides 
unclassified TM’s in Portable Document Format (PDF) and Hypertext Markup language (HTML) formats.  
User accounts can be obtained by accessing the website at https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/.  Other 
websites with NAVAIR TMs may currently exist however they can only be used with TYCOM approval. 

b. Joint Knowledge Caching Server (JKCS) is authorized for use where installed.  JKCS provides 
storage of electronic versions of NAVAIR TM’s on servers, but does not include ongoing replenishment of 
PEMAs.  TM’s hosted on JKCS are updated automatically from the NAVAIR TM website. 

c. NAVAIR TMs issued via CD-ROM are authorized for use only when issued with the approved 
NAVAIR CD-ROM label affixed.  An example of the approved label can be found on the NATEC website.  
CD-ROMs currently available are authorized for use only until their next update.  At the next update, only 
CD-ROMs with the NAVAIR logo are authorized for use.  Local reproduction of CD-ROM for use within 
the organization must be managed by the Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL) and meet the 
current criteria established by the NA 00-25-100.  Exceptions must be approved by the appropriate 
TYCOM. 

1-5 In Adobe Acrobat 9 Reader and Professional, if PDF/A View Mode is set wrong, it kills the hyperlinks 
in a manual when downloaded outside the NATEC website/browser.  To fix the setting: 

● Open Adobe Reader or Adobe Professional. 
● On the toolbar click “Edit” and select “Preference”. 
● At the next screen on the left side under “Categories:” select “Documents”.  Locate “PDF/A View 

Mode” (in the center on the right side) and select “NEVER” from the pull down. 
● Then select “OK”.

2-1 BASIC STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL TECHNICAL 
MANUALS 

2-2 AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE.  Technical Manual Application System (TMAPS) on the NATEC 
website serves as NAVAIR’s single authoritative repository.  TMAPS supports functions including but not 
limited to; metadata index for all NAVAIR TMs of record, storage of digital TMs of record, print on 
demand, Compact Disc on Demand (COD), TM viewing source, Technical Publications Deficiency Report 
(TPDR), Technical Directives (TDs) and replication source for the JKCS component of Joint Technical 
Data Information (JTDI). 

3-1 INTERACTIVE ELECTRONIC TECHNICAL MANUAL INTRODUCTION 

3-2 Several platforms are providing IETM to the CTPL and work centers for maintenance on aircraft.  
Each of these platforms may have different IETMs and different methods of initial distribution and 
updating.  For more information or questions, including training, repair, troubleshooting techniques, 
please contact the platform specific Logistic Element Manager (LEM). 

3-3 Many distributed IETM are also viewable via the NATEC website including H-60, E-6, F/A-18 A thru 
D, F/A-18 E/F and V-22.  Users must have the CITRIX Web Version plug-in, loaded on the computer to 
access IETM.  Users can access the respective IETM from the NATEC Table of Contents page, by 
selecting “Interactive/Electronic Technical Manuals (I/ETM)” listed under the Technical Manuals tab.  Any 
restrictions to IETM utilization for maintenance will be addressed as a pop-up note. 

4-1 CD-ROM 

4-2 NAVAIR TMs issued via CD-ROM are authorized for use only when issued with the approved 
NAVAIR CD-ROM label affixed.  The CD-ROM currently available is authorized for use only until their 
next update.  At the next update, only the CD-ROM with the NAVAIR logo is authorized for use. 

4-3 Local reproduction of CD-ROM for use within the organization must be managed by the CTPL and 
meet the current criteria established in paragraph 7-1.  Exceptions must be approved by the appropriate 
TYCOM. 

4-4 Activities must maintain and control copies of Automatic Distribution Requirements List (ADRL)/CD-
ROM as a backup for JKCS or other electronic TM (ETM) versions in the event access to electronic 
version on servers is interrupted.  For fleet maintainers, the unit Commanding Officer/Officer in Charge 
(CO/OIC) may authorize use of the backup ADRL/CD-ROM under such circumstances. 

4-5 Until the fleet has Internet access at all maintenance facilities, afloat and ashore, NATEC will 
continue to support paper and CD-ROM versions of technical manuals, where required. 

4-6 The current supply Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedure (MILSTRIP) requisition 
procedures will continue to be supported and paper technical manuals will be printed and distributed in 
situations where the maintainer cannot use the web or CD-ROM.  

5-1 REQUEST FOR CD-ROM 

5-2 To provide ample time for delivery, activities should request from NATEC distribution their ADRL on 
CD-ROM (nani_customerservice@navy.mil) 45 to 60 days before deployment. 

5-3 Active communication with NATEC should be maintained to advise of any deployment schedule 
changes or failure to receive CD-ROM(s).  Request should include aircraft platform, shipping address, 
Unit Identification Code (UIC) and NATEC Distribution Account Code (DAC) to expedite delivery. 

6-1 VIEWING PDF TECHNICAL MANUALS ON A CD-ROM 

6-2 Adobe Reader is required to view the manuals contained on the CD-ROM.  A setup wizard for the 
Adobe Reader Program is included on the first CD-ROM of every set. 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 011 00 
30 December 2014

6-3 See the README.TXT file on the first CD-ROM of the set for instructions on loading Adobe Reader 
and viewing the manuals. 

7-1 REPRODUCING PAPER MANUALS FROM DIGITAL TECHNICAL MANUALS 

7-2 It is the CTPL’s responsibility to control manuals printed from the NATEC website/JKCS to ensure 
obsolete versions of TMs are not being used for aviation maintenance.  The minimum requirements for a 
TM printed from the web, CD-ROM or the JKCS would be; the Title Page, all referenced material, all of 
the Numerical Index of Effective Work Packages/Pages, and the desired work packages or pages. 

7-3 CTPL will log in the “Remarks” field of the ELMS Program record or Enhanced Library Management 
System (ELMS) to reflect the composition of the manual.  It would be assigned a copy number, and 
changes to the manual would be controlled by the issuance of Change Entry Certification Records 
(CECRs) (WP 013 00). 

7-4 If printing a manual directly from the NATEC website, be advised that the hyperlinks (e.g. see IRAC 
X) will not be visible in the printed copy unless the individual printer setting is set in accordance with the 
established procedures described by the Adobe Reader version utilized by the activity.  Then select the 
“Printer Icon” on the toolbar of the PDF being viewed (do not use the file menu to print) (See figure 1). 

a. When the print screen appears, the following procedures apply as appropriate to the Adobe Version 
in use by the activity: 

 For Adobe Pro 10.0, some errors exist in printing PDF files.  Contact NATEC Customer Service 
on trouble printing from the website if the paper copy received through Naval Logistics Library is 
corrupted. 

 For Adobe Reader 7.0 – 9.0, in the upper right corner under the “Comments and Forms” drop 
down, select “Documents and Markups”. 

 For Adobe Reader 6.0, in the lower left corner under “Print What” drop down, select “Document 
and Comments”. 

b. This must be done while running the applicable Adobe Reader outside of the Internet Explorer 
browser application in order to save the setting for future use.  If these settings are not saved through the 
Adobe Reader, you will have to change the setting each time before printing. 

c. If there are any questions or need assistance, contact one of the Technical Publication Specialists 
(TPS) at nani_customerservice@navy.mil. 

7-5 When the CTPL librarian is not available (for example, after shift hours and no on-coming librarian is 
available), activity may reproduce portions of TMs that are non-routine for single use and control them.  
The reproduced single use portions are controlled as follows: 

a. A Quality Assurance (QA) Subject Matter Expert (SME) shall review all printed material for 
completeness and ensure proper control. 

b. Identify the reproduced TM in the corrective action block of the Maintenance Action Form (MAF) or 
work order by annotating the manual number and specific pages that were printed.  Example: NA 01-1A-
35 dtd 01 Aug 05, pgs 1-1 thru 1-10, total of 10 pgs. 

c. The work center supervisor (WCS) shall ensure that all printed material is accounted for and 
destroyed upon completion of a maintenance action per procedure outlined in this TM.  The supervisor’s 
signature on the MAF or work order indicates that the printed material has been verified current, 
accounted for, and destroyed in accordance with WP 013 00, paragraph 17-6.  

d. For recurring maintenance actions, TM reproduction requirements remain as prescribed in this 
paragraph. 

e. During work center audits, monitors, and spot inspections, QA shall ensure no unauthorized/ 
outdated TMs or partial copies thereof are kept in the work center.

NOTE 

Non-routine TM is defined as a non-CTPL generated reproduced TM or a reproduced 
partial TM. 

8-1 INTERIM RAPID ACTION CHANGE/ELECTRONIC RAPID ACTION CHANGE BINDER 

8-2 Electronic Rapid Action Changes (ERACs) support the sustainment of IETMs and accomplish the 
purpose and function of Interim Rapid Action Changes (IRACs) in a digital format. 

a. ERACs meet the electronic requirements of specific platforms and are issued in accordance with 
those conditions warranting an IRAC as defined in MIL-DTL-81748. 

b. Individual program requirements dictate the presentation systems used to display ERACs and drive 
the specific format of those ERACs issued. 

8-3 An IRAC/ERAC binder is MANDATORY.  The following procedures shall be used by activities when 
incorporating IRACs or ERACs affecting manuals viewed on the NATEC website, COD, JKCS, or IETM: 

a. Maintaining an IRAC/ERAC Binder electronically or paper format is at the discretion of the activity, 
based on the requirements of the activity.  The electronic IRAC/ERAC Binder will be maintained in 
accordance with SECNAVINST 5216.5.  

b. Maintain an IRAC/ERAC binder for each work center utilizing digital TMs.  This IRAC/ERAC binder 
will contain all unincorporated IRACs for all an activity’s publications maintained on JKCS. 

c. An IRAC/ERAC binder shall also be made available for each PEMA maintained. 

d. The IRAC/ERAC binder will contain all unincorporated IRACs for TMs maintained on JKCS and 
website downloads and shall be reviewed prior to searching for TM.  This binder shall be purged monthly 
after JKCS is updated. 

e. If activity maintains COD CDs, an IRAC/ERAC binder will also be maintained and controlled. 

f. Purged IRACs shall be kept on file with the ADRL CD and viewed prior to looking at TM on the ADRL 
CD.  Maintaining ADRL CDs at the depot level is optional. 

g. Electronic media does not require CTPL stamps at this time.  

8-4 Activities using ETMs/IETMs will maintain an IRAC/ERAC binder.  

9-1 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

9-2 CTPL librarian(s) shall maintain an accurate ADRL for all TMs used by their activity.  The ADRL shall 
include all TMs required, whether accessed via JKCS, NATEC website, CD-ROM or paper format.  
Maintaining an accurate ADRL also helps NAVAIR to accurately assess funding requirements for initial 
print and distribution of TMs. 

9-3 If CTPL librarians elect to manage only the JKCS electronic TM and automatic distribution of paper 
or CD-ROM is not desired, CTPL librarians should identify these TMs on their ADRL (identified by Pub 
Type “E” on the TM record in the ELMS Program only) with a quantity of zero.  This will maintain visibility 
of all TMs required, but will not result in unnecessary distribution of paper TMs or CD-ROM to those 
CTPL(s) that do not require this distribution.  

9-4 CTPLs with approved NATEC distribution accounts will receive automatic email notification of 
updates to all TMs on their ADRL regardless of media. 

9-5 Although NAVAIR technical manuals will be available on the NATEC website and JKCS, the 
activity’s CTPL will continue to be responsible for local technical library management and control.  
Downloading of electronic manuals from the NATEC website and JKCS shall be monitored and controlled 
by the CTPL.

9-6 For help in resolving JTDI/JKCS problems, contact one of the following for assistance: 

Phone:  1-888-583-4767 
Email:  “help@jtdisos.us” or Website: https://upw.jtdi.mil/. 

9-7 The JTDI/JKCS Administrator and User’s Guides are available on the JTDI website at 
https://upw.jtdi.mil.  Users can request access, once registered they will be able to access the document 
center inside the JTDI website.  The CTPL librarian shall train the Dispersed Technical Publications 
Library (DTPL) librarian(s) in the use of JKCS to include the responsibility to control printed material.  

10-1 ISSUE CONTROL 

10-2 By agreement between NAVAIR, NAVSUP and TYCOMs, TM replenishment is limited by the Naval 
Logistics Library (NLL) and Defense Automatic Addressing System Center (DAASC) web systems to no 
more than three copies each.  CTPL(s) are requested to refrain from placing multiple requisitions to 
circumvent this limitation.  

10-3 Exceptions to the three-copy limitations are requisitions initiated for; hot ships, cash sales, Foreign 
Military Sales (FMS) requisitions, and Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization 
(NATOPS) requests routed via the Logistics Element Manager (LEM), and other justifiable requirements 
identified by COMNAVAIRFOR and TYCOMs via NATEC.  

11-1 VERIFICATION OF RELEASED TECHNICAL MANUAL UPDATES 

11-2 The IRAC/Technical Manual Weekly Summary message is CTPL audit tool in verifying latest 
releases against TMs.  However, due to delays in mailing updated paper TMs and CD-ROMs the 
summaries may not agree with current TM version on hand.  When a TM on an activity’s ADRL is added 
or changed on the website, the appropriate CTPL(s) will be notified via email.  The CTPL librarian must 
ensure their library management database accurately reflects the status of TM(s) and any subsequent 
updates, whether electronic or hard copy.

3-1 JOINT TECHNICAL DATA INTEGRATION  

3-2 The Joint Technical Data Integration (JTDI) complement of servers also includes a Top Tier server 
configured to host most proprietary IETMs.  The Top Tier IETM Hosting function is linked to NATEC’s 
TMAPS to present a seamless interface to the customer.  Update of the JTDI Top Tier is achieved by 
program office CDs provided to, and forwarded by, NATEC Distribution to the JTDI processing unit.  
Before forwarding CDs, NATEC Distribution validates metadata on electronic print order sheet (ePOS) 
(furnished by LEM) and updates TMAPS.  Only CDs forwarded by NATEC are accepted by the JTDI Top 
Tier team.  Proprietary IETMs hosted on the Top Tier are NOT replicated to the local servers.  Refer to 
the JTDI IETM hosting policy letter posted on the NATEC website for criteria and details.  

3-3 The JTDI IETM access is enabled through the use of a CITRIX client and in some cases standard 
browser access.  Therefore, users must have CITRIX Web Version plug-in, loaded on their computer to 
access the IETM.  Policies concerning management of electronic technical manuals (ETMs) are located 
on NATEC website. 

3-4 NMCI users must submit a Move, Add, Change (MAC) request specifying the application name 
(CITRIX ICA Client for 32 Bit Windows) and the latest available Instance name (e.g., 
L_CITRIX21144_631_W2K).  Alternatively, a project MAC can be submitted for a large group at a single 
site.  Individuals should contact their NMCI POC and modify their software mapping to add CITRIX to 
their NMCI profile. 

3-5 For non-NMCI users, the CITRIX client can be downloaded from the CITRIX website at 
http://www.citrix.com/site/ss/downloads/index.asp.  

4-1 JOINT KNOWLEDGE CACHING SERVER 

4-2 Joint Knowledge Caching Server (JKCS) is a component of the JTDI Program and is composed of 
hardware and software fielded for the purpose of hosting TMs on a server, afloat or ashore, to improve 
access and response time to NAVAIR technical manuals.  These are the same TMs available on the 
NATEC website and represent the subset of TMs that comprise the merging of all ADRLs at the JTDI 
designated sites. 

4-3 JKCS has been installed onboard several ship, shore and overseas installations.  For a complete 
and updated list of installations, go to https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/ and logon to the website.  Select 
the JTDI Stats link at the bottom of the “Table of Contents”.  Select the JKCS/TM Server Site IP Address 
List link.  This will display a table of all current JKCS/TM Server sites. 

NOTE 

The NATEC website, JTDI, JKCS, and PEMAs are the ONLY official repositories for 
storage and access to digital NAVAIR TMs.  Deviation from this policy will require a 
written waiver from COMNAVAIRFOR Code N4222C.  

4-4 Local server initial load and update procedures: 

a. An initial load of TMs and hardware functionality check is accomplished by NATEC 6.8.4 and Aranea 
Solutions or JTDI personnel. 

b. TMs on a local JKCS having adequate bandwidth are refreshed on a daily basis via Internet 
transmission to the server of the latest updates posted to the NATEC website.  

4-5 Manuals on a local JKCS are authorized for maintenance use with the same restrictions as manuals 
downloaded from the NATEC website.  Reproduction of partial or complete manuals will be handled in 
accordance with WP 011 00, paragraph 7-1.  

4-6 Although NAVAIR technical manuals will be available on the NATEC website and JKCS, the 
activity’s CTPL librarian will continue to be responsible for local technical library management and control.  
Downloading of electronic manuals from the NATEC website and JKCS shall be monitored and controlled 
by the CTPL.

1-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL UPDATE METHODS 

1-2 Technical documentation usability is defined as how effectively the presented information describes 
the system or equipment configuration and required maintenance data.  In general, hardware 
configurations and maintenance concepts are fluid.  These changes are usually the results of efforts to 
improve either mission or maintenance capabilities.  Therefore, it is mandatory that the Naval Air Systems 
Command (NASC) maintain an effective, update method to ensure that technical manuals (TMs) keep 
pace with hardware configuration.  RACs and responses to TPDRs, will not be used to make pen and ink 
changes to any NAVAIR technical publication. 

1-3 TMs are updated through the issuance of Rapid Action Changes/Interim Rapid Action Changes 
(RACs/IRACs), Formal Changes, Revisions, Pick-up Revisions, or NAVAIR TM Notices.  After a manual 
is posted to the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) website, it may take 
up to 60 days for the paper version to be delivered.  During this 60 day period, the manual will not be 
available for requisitioning and the Enhanced Library Management System (ELMS) Audit Library record 
will have a yellow “D” icon.  If the new paper version of the manual is not received within 60 days of being 
posted on the NATEC website, the prior version of the paper manual is to be considered out-of-date and 
the new version posted to the NATEC website is authorized for use.  In some cases Technical Manual 
Logistics Managers may opt to distribute changes to manuals that are 40 pages or less digitally.  In those 
cases you will receive an email notification that the change is posted to the NATEC website and you need 
to download and locally print it and collate it into your manual. 

1-4 Commands shall contact the NAVAIR Program Office TM technical content owner representative 
Logistics Element Manager (LEM) or Data Manager (DM) when updated paper copies are not received 
via automatic distribution within 60 days of being posted to the NATEC website.  Contact information for 
LEMs and DMs are listed under the “POC/LEM” section of the publication information (NSN, PDF, Model, 
IRAC, etc.) displayed after performing a search for the TM via the Central Repository in TMAPS. 

1-5 For revisions and changes to Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization 
(NATOPS) program publications, refer to OPNAVINST 3710.7. 

1-6 Effective technical directive (TD) changes and bulletins, which affects Aviation Life Support Systems 
(ALSS) equipment and clothing issued between ALSS manuals (paper and CD) updates will be filed in a 
separate binder in the ALSS work center (on a controlled basis).  Refer to paragraph 8-1 in this work 
package for guidance.

2-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL RAPID ACTION CHANGE 

2-2 TM RAC is applicable to TMs supporting all in-production and out-of-production NAVAIR weapons 
systems such as: maintenance instruction manuals, related component equipment manuals, maintenance 
requirement cards (MRCs), illustrated parts breakdown (IPB), support equipment (SE), weapons handling 
and loading manuals, calibration manuals, and other related procedural manuals.  As the electronic age 
of TMs progresses formal changes will be discontinued in favor of revisions and IRACs.  All other sources 
of updates to NAVAIR TMs are unauthorized and must be referred to NATEC via a Technical Publications 
Deficiency Report (TPDR) entered into the Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS) for appropriate 
action (WP 015 00).  Until this process is fully implemented, when a paper copy of the updated manual is 
received as one of the following updates listed below, the primary/alternate librarian will verify all the 
changed/revised pages are incorporated in that release by validating the Numerical Index of Effective 
Work Packages/Pages (A Page) to the pages. 

2-3 Incorporation of RACs and IRACs into the affected TMs (paper copy) shall be within two working 
days upon receipt by the work center.  All outstanding TM RACs should be against the latest formal 
change or revision to the manual.  If this is not the case a TPDR should be issued against the manual. 

2-4 TECHNICAL MANUAL RAPID ACTION CHANGE provides urgent TM change data.  TM RACs are 
developed to expedite the issuance of technical information, which relates to safety of personnel/flight, 
aircraft grounding, mission capability/fleet readiness, equipment damage, and/or environmental impact 
restrictions.  TM RACs will be of the following types: 

a. IRACs – Issued by Naval activities or Contract Administrative Offices (CAO) as a Naval Message 
(Type A) or as a formal Naval letter with replacement page enclosures issued as a pdf file (Type B).  For 
examples, refer to figure 1 and figure 2.  IRACS for electronic TM (ETM) will be maintained by either of 
the following methods; 1.  IRAC Binder (paper format), 2. IRAC Folder (electronic format).   IRACs must 
be accessible to all users and kept on file until updated changes are available and incorporated.  .  For 
additional information on maintaining an IRAC/ERAC Binder, refer to WP 011 00, paragraph 8-1. 

b. RACs – Issued by Naval activities or CAOs as a complete formal change to TM (including all 
associated format matter).  Hard copy shall be used to issue IRACs containing information in the form of 
illustrations, schematics, wiring diagrams and other forms, which cannot be issued as messages.  

2-5 RACs and IRACs shall be numbered consecutively throughout the life of the TM beginning with RAC 
or IRAC number 1.  Sequence of numbers is independent of type of IRAC or RAC, e.g., number 1 could 
be a Type A IRAC, number 2 a RAC, and number 3 a Type B IRAC, etc.  The program Technical Data 
Logistics Element Manager (LEM) or designee approved by the program LEM has final authority 
regarding RAC and IRAC numbering.  Cancelled RAC and IRAC numbers shall not be reused. 

2-6 All Foreign Military Sales (FMS) unique TMs including customized and sanitized are numbered 
uniquely and therefore all IRACs applicable to these manuals must be issued or reissued against the 
unique FMS TM number. 

2-7 Electronic Rapid Action Changes (ERACs) support the sustainment of Interactive Electronic 
Technical Manuals (IETM) and accomplish the purpose and function of IRACs in a digital format.  
Individual program requirements dictate the presentation systems used to display ERACs and drive the 
specific format of those ERACs issued.  

2-8 RAPID ACTION CHANGE is a complete, formal change to applicable TMs.  In addition to the 
pertinent technical content change information, RACs provide all the associated TM format data, such as 
title page, front matter, indices, etc.  RACs shall be used to disseminate urgent TM change information 
when funding, contractual and programmatic conditions make their use practical 

2-9 INTERIM RAPID ACTION CHANGE may be used when funding, contractual and programmatic 
circumstances make the use of a RAC impractical.  Formal incorporation of an IRAC into the TM is still 
required and must be accomplished by a formal change, revision, or RAC. 

a. IRACs are issued in two types: 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 012 00 
30 December 2014  

3 
 

(1) Type A – issued as a Naval Message to provide urgent TM change data, with the exception of 
graphic images, schematics, wiring diagrams, etc., which are unsuitable for delivery by Naval Message 
(figure 1).  Upon receipt of an applicable Type A IRAC, TM users are directed to annotate the IRACs 
applicability to effected pages and maintain the IRAC behind the title page of the manual.  Type A IRACs 
provide information that applies to text and routine tabular information. 

(2) Type B – issued when urgent TM changes for schematics, wiring diagrams, or other graphic 
images, and other forms of graphic data cannot be included in a Type A IRAC.  TM replacement or new 
pages are generally issued as enclosures to the Type B IRAC cover letter.  Type B IRACs will be issued 
primarily as a digital file.  A hard copy will only be utilized when special printing is required and will be 
handled as follows: 

 Upon receipt of an applicable Type B IRAC (figure 2).  TM users are directed to insert enclosed 
change pages.  The applicable cover letter is maintained behind the existing title page and 
additional effected pages are annotated as applicable. 

 Type B IRACs shall be developed in a manner that allows the fleet user to download and print 
them from the NATEC website, so that the user can easily insert and replace them within the 
existing TM. 

b. Formal updates shall include incorporation of all outstanding IRACs pertaining to the TM.  IRACs not 
incorporated during the update shall be reconciled by cancelling then reissuing them against the updated 
TM using a new IRAC number. 

2-10 The main purpose of an IRAC is to ensure that the same correct technical information and its related 
requirements are communicated to those that require the information.  The following details must be 
included in the IRAC: 

● A notice that pen and ink changes are never authorized. 
● The exact location and description of the change explained in detail. 
● The text of the IRAC shall be clear, accurate, concise, and shall be worded in the same style and 

format as the affected TM. 

2-11 INTERIM RAPID ACTION CHANGE INCORPORATION INTO THE TECHNICAL MANUAL.  The 
following procedures shall be used when incorporating IRACs into paper TMs (See figure 3): 

NOTE 

Digital copies of the entire TM with the applicable IRAC or RAC inserted and 
bookmarked are made available on the NATEC website. 

a. Insert a copy of the IRAC directly behind the title page and note its existence on the manual page to 
which it applies.  Mark the specific change area affected and annotate the List of Effective Pages or List 
of Effective Cards (Page A) with a vertical line in the margin next to the changed data, opposite the 
binding and annotate the appropriate identifying information across the top of the vertical line with the 
statement “SEE IRAC #” in the text area of the page or card.  Enter the IRAC number in pencil in the 
margin.  

b. For double-column material, mark the center margin if the inner paragraph is affected and the outer 
margin if the outer paragraph is affected.  For single-column material, mark the specific change area 
affected with a vertical line in the margin opposite the binding edge.  The line shall extend the entire 
length of the material affected.  The entry shall be made in pencil to allow the erasure of the line in the 
margin in the event of another IRAC affecting the same area. 

c. Each Type B IRAC enclosure (new or replacement pages) shall be inserted into its proper place with 
the TM as directed.  Superseded and cancelled pages shall be removed from the manual as directed. 

d. Retain all IRACs, including appropriately marked cancelled IRAC title pages, in the manual until 
receipt of the next formal update to the manual that includes a reference to each IRAC.  See paragraph 2-
13 for applicable guidelines. 

e. The following procedures shall be used when incorporating IRACs affecting laminated manuals: 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 012 00 
30 December 2014  

4 
 

 Affix an adhesive label (i.e. modified mailing label so it does not cover any maintenance task) on 
the laminated pages or cards and annotate the IRAC number as would be the procedure for non-
laminated pages or cards.  The information on the adhesive label should be legible and removed 
and replaced on the active manual when it becomes Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  

 Maintain the IRAC with the manual until incorporated.  

f. Refer to paragraph 2-13 in this work package for guidance on cancelled IRACs. 

2-12 INTERIM RAPID ACTION CHANGE INCORPORATION INTO THE DIGITAL TECHNICAL 
MANUAL.   

a. The following procedures shall be used when incorporating IRACs affecting manuals on digital 
media, e.g., CD-ROM or DVD: 

 Affix an adhesive label to the media case annotated with the applicable NAVAIR publication 
number and the IRAC number.  The information on the adhesive label should be legible and 
positioned to allow for additional IRACs as they occur.  

 Maintain the IRAC on file until receipt of the superseding media. 

 For IRACs affecting IETMs maintain a copy of the IRAC in the IRAC/ERAC binder until an ERAC 
has been received, installed and verified within the IETM.  

b. The following procedures shall be used for deploying activities when incorporating IRACs affecting 
manuals on Joint Knowledge Caching Server (JKCS):  Maintain an IRAC/ERAC binder for each work 
center utilizing JKCS.  This binder will contain all unincorporated IRACs for publications maintained on 
JKCS.  It shall be reviewed and purged monthly after JKCS is updated.  For additional information on 
maintaining an IRAC/ERAC Binder, refer to WP 011 00, paragraph 8-1. 

2-13 RETAINING CANCELLED RAPID ACTION CHANGE AND INTERIM RAPID ACTION CHANGE.   

NOTE 

An IRAC can only be corrected by the issuance of another IRAC to cancel or cancel 
and supersede the existing IRAC.  Messages which are not IRACs cannot be used to 
correct, supplement or cancel an existing IRAC. 

a. If a RAC is issued with obsolete, incorrect, or incomplete data, it will be corrected by issuing a new 
RAC with the next RAC number in sequence with the affected pages corrected. The TM title page will 
contain a supersedure statement, which reads, “This RAC supersedes RAC No_.” Minor errors not 
affecting technical content may be corrected by issuing a NAVAIR TM Notice as described in this WP." 

b. An IRAC issued with obsolete, incorrect, or incomplete data, will be cancelled or cancelled and 
superseded by issuing a new IRAC with the next IRAC number in sequence.  A Type A or a Type B IRAC 
may be used to cancel either type of IRAC.  Cancellation IRACs will include the following direction: 

(1) Within the PURPOSE OF CHANGE:  “This IRAC (cancels) or (cancels and supersedes) IRAC 
X.”  (the cancelled IRAC number will be in place of X).  If more than one IRAC is being cancelled, each 
shall be listed. 

(2) Within the DETAILED INFORMATION:  “”IRAC X (the cancelled IRAC number will be in place 
of X) is (cancelled) or (cancelled and superseded) by this IRAC.  Using bold letters mark the first page of 
IRAC X with “CANCELLED BY IRAC Y” (the cancellation IRAC number will be in place of Y).  Ensure that 
the IRAC number and Purpose of Change statement of the cancelled IRAC are visible (note that the 
Purpose of Change statement may be on the second page).  In the appropriate margin of each page that 
the cancelled IRAC affected indicate that it has been cancelled by this IRAC.  Retain only the cancelled 
IRAC page(s) with the “Cancelled by IRAC” and “Purpose of Change” statements; all other cancelled 
IRAC pages shall be removed and discarded.”” If more than one IRAC is being cancelled, each shall be 
listed. 

c. Mark the first page of each cancelled IRAC as directed.  In the appropriate margin of each page that 
the cancelled IRAC affected annotate with “SEE IRAC “X” (X represents the cancelling IRAC number).  
Retain appropriately marked first page of cancelled IRAC in sequence behind title page of applicable TM.

If the Purpose of Change statement is on the second page, retain that page as well.  Remove and discard 
remaining cancelled IRAC pages. 

d. IRACs not incorporated during a manual update, or issued after the TM data cutoff date (copy freeze 
date), will be reconciled by cancelling then reissuing them as a new IRAC with the next IRAC number in 
sequence against the current change or revision of the affected manual. 

e. A PDF file of the complete manual with all applicable IRAC(s) appropriately collated and bookmarked 
will be uploaded to the NATEC website by the IRAC issuing activity.  Only the (appropriately 
watermarked) title page of each cancelled IRAC will be included in the collated PDF file.  All other pages 
of the cancelled IRAC will be removed. A blank back-up page will be inserted behind the cancelled title 
page to preserve accurate pagination. A stand-alone PDF copy of the cancelled IRAC will be maintained 
in the TMAPS Central Repository. 

f. CTPLs may, at their discretion, review their paper distribution copies for TMs containing cancelled 
IRACs and (as described above) annotate the cancelled IRAC title page with the cancelling IRAC number 
and remove all other applicable cancelled IRAC pages. 

3-1 FORMAL CHANGE TO A CONVENTIONAL MANUAL 

3-2 A routine manual change is the official release of new or corrected pages to a part or portion of an 
existing document.  A change consists of replacement pages for that area of the manual affected by the 
change.  This approach provides both an economical and expedient method of issuing new or corrected 
material to the user.  Upon issue of the change, it is necessary for the recipient to remove the superseded 
pages and insert the new pages. 

3-3 Each page containing changed or added material bears the word “Change XXX” placed at the 
bottom of the page in the same corner and on the same line with the page number.  For foldout pages, 
the change number is placed in the lower-outer corner of the page beneath the Figure title.  This change 
number requirement is applicable to all added pages, including those placed at the end of a manual. 

4-1 FORMAL CHANGE TO A WORK PACKAGE MANUAL 

4-2 Formal change shall be prepared to a work package (WP) manual.  If the work package manual is a 
single work package manual containing 50 pages or less it may be changed or may be revised when the 
total of changed pages and pages being changed exceeds 60% of the total pages in the manual.  The 
change may consist of one or more revised, added or changed WPs.  A WP may be changed when one 
or more pages have been affected by the current change to the WP manual, or when a WP must have a 
Rapid Action Change (RAC) issued against it.  A changed WP shall consist of a changed WP title page 
and those pages affected by the change to the WP, including unchanged backup pages, if applicable.  

4-3 When a change is prepared to a WP manual or volume, the change may consist of one or more 
added or changed WPs.  The numerical index of effective work packages/pages (A Page) shall account 
for all added, changed, or deleted WPs affected by the change, as well as previous changes to the 
manual, if applicable. 

5-1 REVISION OF A NAVAIR TECHNICAL MANUAL 

5-2 A revision is a second or subsequent edition of a manual that supersedes the previous edition.  A 
revision constitutes a complete reissue of a manual with all updated information incorporated.  
Identification of a revision is made by a supersedure notice on the title page and a new issue date. 

6-1 PICK-UP REVISION TO A NAVAIR TECHNICAL MANUAL 

6-2 This is an economical way of putting out a complete manual to alleviate a low stock situation in the 
warehouse.  Before printing a new change the change is collated into the manual and the whole manual 
is printed for distribution and stock.  A pick-up revision incorporates the basic manual, all previous  

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 012 00

6 
 

changes and the new data that would require the issuance of an additional change.  Only those changed, 
revised or added WPs/pages shall have the current change number and date. 

7-1 NAVAIR TECHNICAL MANUAL NOTICE 

7-2 The NAVAIR TM Notice is the method for correcting minor errors in NAVAIR TMs that do not require 
the issuance of a formal change.  It shall apply only to unclassified TMs, including Periodic Maintenance 
Requirement Manuals (PMRM) issued as cards, and checklists.  Issuance of the NAVAIR TM Notice is 
limited to and shall be utilized only for omissions/corrections of title and “A” pages, and replacement/ 
missing pages and dates, not for correction to technical content. 

7-3 Replacement text pages shall be issued only to correct typographical errors or to replace illegible 
copy.  Replacement pages shall be prepared in the same style and format and shall not exceed five 
pages.  NAVAIR TM Notices shall not be used to correct and/or change the technical content of NAVAIR 
manuals. 

7-4 The NAVAIR TM Notice shall contain the publication number, a date which is at least one day later 
than the formal change date or the basic date if there are no changes of the manual, card(s), or checklist 
to be corrected and include a clear, concise reason for the Notice.  The identifier, Notice, shall be in 
boldface type and placed on the four corners (figure 4). 

7-5 NAVAIR TM Notices are not listed on “A” pages of NAVAIR TMs.  NAVAIR TM Notice sheets in 
paper manuals shall be retained directly behind the title page regardless of existing or subsequently 
issued IRACs.  Retain the NOTICE until incorporated by a change or revision.  

8-1 DOCUMENTATION OF A TECHNICAL DIRECTIVE TO AVIATION LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS 
MANUAL (PAPER OR CD) 

8-2 Applicable TD changes and bulletins which affect ALSS equipment and clothing will be filed in a 
separate binder in the ALSS work center (on a controlled basis).  Annotate the applicable paper manual 
as follows: 

a. For double-column material, mark the center margin if the inner paragraph is affected and the outer 
margin if the outer paragraph is affected. 

b. For single-column material, mark the specific change area affected with a vertical line in the margin 
opposite the binding edge. 

c. The line shall extend the entire length of the material affected.  The entry shall be made in pencil to 
allow room in the margin in the event of another TD affecting the same area.  Enter the TD number in 
pencil in the margin. 

d. Retain all applicable TDs to the manual until receipt of the next formal update to the manual and 
validate the TD is incorporated. 

8-3 The following procedures shall be used to annotate applicable TDs affecting manuals on the CD-
ROM: 

a. Affix an adhesive label to the CD-ROM case annotated with the applicable NAVAIR publication 
number and the TD number.  The information on the adhesive label should be legible and positioned to 
allow for additional TDs as they occur.  

b. Maintain the TD on file until receipt of the superseding CD-ROM and validate the TD is incorporated.

1-1 CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY ACCESS TO NAVAL AIR TECHNICAL DATA 
AND ENGINEERING SERVICE CENTER WEBSITE AND TECHNICAL MANUAL APPLICATION 
SYSTEM 

1-2 The Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) technical manual (TM) 
website provides distribution of NAVAIR Electronic Technical Manuals (ETMs) via the World Wide 
Web/Internet.  To access the website the user must have an approved account.  Obtain a user account 
by going to the website’s Universal Resource Locator (URL) address https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/. 

1-3 Non-US citizens are not authorized access to the NATEC website without Chief of Naval Operations 
(CNO) approved waivers on file.  Refer to SECNAVINST 5510.34 for guidelines and procedures.  

1-4 Access to the NATEC website is user-ID and password controlled.  In order to receive an account, a 
user must complete the user account request on the NATEC Website.  Locate the box heading “Log In” 
then click “New User”.  At the next screen read “NATEC Account Request” and click the button for 
request type, Government Employee/Military or Contractor.  Follow the guidelines provided for the 
requested type of account.  All mandatory information must be filled-in.  Due to security reasons, account 
requests with Internet email accounts (hotmail.com, yahoo.com, netscape.com, etc.) will not be 
processed.  Requesters are required to have a current email address ending in “.mil” or “.gov”.  

1-5 Access to the website requires a reasonably fast connection to the Internet, a standard web browser 
such as Internet Explorer, and the Adobe Portable Data Format (PDF) reader/viewer.  The Adobe PDF 
viewer can be downloaded from the Adobe website on the Internet at no cost.  The website is designed to 
make access to the technical manual, work package, chapter, illustration, or figure as fast and easy as 
possible.  The website can be searched by Type Equipment Code (TEC), platform, TM number, or title, 
and supports text searches within the manuals. 

1-6 Although NAVAIR TMs will be available on the NATEC website the activity Central Technical 
Publications Library (CTPL) librarian will continue to be responsible for local technical library management 
and control. 

1-7 The Technical Manual Application System (TMAPS) is the Naval Air System Command’s (NAVAIR) 
automated technical data information and distribution system.  It can be viewed by anyone authorized to 
access the NATEC website.  However, access to certain functions and the ability to enter or modify data 
requires specific permissions. 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 013 00 
30 December 2014

1-8 CD On-line Ordering via the NATEC website.  CD On-line Ordering allows the CTPL librarian to 
order individual TMs listed on their Automatic Distribution Requirements List (ADRL) or their entire ADRL 
on CD-ROM(s).  Deploying activities must order their ADRL CD set 45 to 60 days prior to deployment for 
use as a backup to the NATEC website or Joint Knowledge Caching Server (JKCS) in the event access 
to the TM electronic version on local servers or the NATEC web is interrupted.  

1-9 TMs on the CDs are only as current as the date printed on the face label.  CTPL will not receive 
updates for TM(s) on CD on Demand (COD).  When notification is received that a publication within a 
COD has been updated, a new COD must be requested.  A request will not be made earlier than ten 
working days after notification.  Type Wings shall provide specific written guidance as to library 
management procedures when using COD. 

2-1 UPDATING NAVAL AIR TECHNICAL DATA AND ENGINEERING SERVICE CENTER USER 
ACCOUNT 

2-2 When a new primary/alternate librarian assumes the responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the 
CTPL, one of the first tasks to accomplish is update the individual’s “User Account” in the NATEC 
website, and then complete the information in the “Customer Account” in the Enhanced Library 
Management System (ELMS) (if on ELMS).  This assists NATEC in contacting the current primary 
librarian with any questions about the activity’s CTPL.  When the new librarian primary/alternate has any 
questions while filling out any of the information in user account (NATEC website) or Customer Account 
(ELMS) (primary librarian completes this information), please contact the closest Technical Publications 
Specialist (TPS) listed in WP 003 00. 

2-3 Once in the NATEC website validate/update the following information blocks in “My User Account” 
(See figure 1): 

a. “User Information” – 

 User’s full name, 
 Rank/Rate/Grade, 

 Command (for example, U.S. Navy, USMC, etc.), 

 Phone/FAX number, 

 CTPL Status (Yes must be selected if you are a librarian in your activity), 

 Distribution Account Code (DAC).  NOTE:  Standard Navy Distribution List (SNDL)/First position 
need to be five characters/spaces in length. 

 Email Notification (select yes, this will notify you when a new TM on your ADRL is released), 

 Default Bandwidth (High or Low). 
 “Your Command/Company Information” – 

 Command/Company Information, 

 Address, 

 Street, 

 City, State and Zip Code.  Once this information is correct, click “Submit”. 

b. The next screen will list the names of personnel associated with the activity’s DAC.  At this screen, 
click and remove all the personnel no longer associated with your DAC and then click submit.  Update is 
completed when the box appears stating “Thank you for your assistance in this update.”  This task is 
complete and you are now ready to enter TMAPS. 

c. Once the “My User Account” is updated, the new primary/alternate librarian needs to request ELMS 
permission for activity’s DAC.  Submit for ELMS permissions on the NATEC website (Customer Service 
Support Desk) or send an email to nani_customerservice@navy.mil and provide the following information 
at a minimum; Activity’s DAC and requestor’s Username ID (this is located on the “myNATEC Technical 
Data Website Homepage” under “myNATEC Account Information” or “My User Account”), (figure 2).  
Provide any additional information to assist NATEC in expediting request.   

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 013 00 
30 December 2014  

3 

d. After ELMS update permissions are granted and you are the primary librarian, enter ELMS and click 
“Customer Account”.  Once in the “Customer Accounts Update Screen”, validate and update the following 
boxes (figure 3); 

 Maintenance Level/Unit Identification Code (UIC), 

 Mailing Address, 

 Point of Contact (POC), 

 Type command, account designation, 

 Media/Quantity, 

 Type Equipment Code, then click “Submit”. 

e. This area will also be validated and updated anytime a CTPL librarians comes onboard, when the 
activity deploys longer than 30 days and upon return, and when there are any changes to the “User 
Account” in the NATEC website, and Customer Account in ELMS (if on ELMS). 

3-1 LIBRARY RESPONSIBILITY 

3-2 Activity Commanding Officer is responsible for the development, establishment, and operation of 
technical library services in support of local operations and maintenance.  Activity Commanding Officer 
shall designate an appropriate officer to implement and carry out policies and procedures to effectively 
maintain an aeronautical technical library.  This work package is applicable to organizational, intermediate 
and Depot level libraries, with the exception of Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) Depot (Level 3) libraries, 
which are discussed in WP 013 01. 

3-3 Management of the technical library is a function assigned to the Quality Assurance (QA) Division of 
Navy and Marine Corps Aviation Units.  The technical library’s responsibilities include functions and tasks 
as follows: 

a. Maintain a CTPL, which is adequate to complete the assigned functions of the activity.  Retention of 
master copies of publications within the CTPL is optional. 

b. Requisition, receive, screen, review, route, distribute, as necessary, and file all incoming technical 
publications. 

c. Establish dispersed libraries and necessary control functions. 

d. Establish and maintain a training program for assigned library personnel, including dispersed 
librarians. 

e. Develop an automatic verification program. 

f. Establish and maintain a program to distribute data to dispersed libraries. 

g. Develop and maintain a program for classified technical data receipt, stowage, distribution, inventory, 
and disposition. 

h. Establish and maintain a program to audit the CTPL annually (WP 014 00) and dispersed libraries 
quarterly (WP 014 00), as a minimum.  

i. Develop an effective checklist so that discrepancies identified during audits can be identified and 
corrective action noted.  Refer to COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 Computerized Self Evaluation Checklist 
(CSEC). 

j. QA Officers, Division Officers and key supervisors, i.e., QA Chief, Work Center Supervisors (WCSs), 
must become involved and knowledgeable of library operations.  

k. Of critical importance is the need to ensure that assigned personnel have the necessary supervision 
and support required to ensure all facets of library management are correctly functioning. 

l. Outdated manuals, wrong type and quantity of manuals on-hand, lack of use and lack of command 
attention are caused primarily by a limited knowledge of the Technical Publications Library System. 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 013 00 
30 December 2014

m. Often, because of the operational tempo and lack of personnel, CTPL assignments are given to 
inexperienced and junior personnel.  Because this frequently occurs, senior personnel must be capable of 
providing the much needed management guidance to the assigned CTPL librarian. 

n. TPS (WP 003 00) is available to assist the user community in any problem area related to technical 
publication libraries.  The use of the TPS is encouraged, since they are a vital link between NATEC, the 
supply system and the user community.  Problems and difficult situations can be minimized for all 
concerned through the prompt and effective utilization of the TPS. 

4-1 TYPES OF LIBRARIES 

4-2 To be effective, the technical publication library must be a centrally managed function.  Therefore, 
based on an activity’s organization, there may be three types of libraries; 

● CTPL, 
● number of dispersed libraries in the work centers, and 
● Naval Warfare Publications (NWP) library maintaining Naval Air Training and Operating 

Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) and tactical manuals in the Operations Department. 

4-3 CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY (CTPL) coordinate and manage an activity’s 
TM functions and shall be responsible for the analysis of TM requirements, procurements of documents, 
receipt and local distribution, security compliance, maintenance, and update of all TMs under their 
cognizance and applicable to the activity.  CTPL may have any number of Dispersed Technical 
Publications Libraries (DTPLs) under their management control. 

a. The CTPL shall act as the activity’s single point of contact with NATEC concerning automatic 
distribution requirements of all NAVAIR manuals including NATOPS/tactical manuals.   

b. Inventory control of the NATOPS/tactical manuals will require special management attention with the 
unit’s NATOPS officer. 

c. Because of the size and unique characteristics of the operating unit, it may be more feasible to 
establish an additional CTPL.  When this system is elected, each library operation will be considered a 
CTPL, responsible for establishing/directing additional controls on dispersed libraries. 

d. For continuity, effective operation and adequate training, personnel assigned to a CTPL should be 
retained in the billet a minimum of 1 year.  Personnel assigned as CTPL at depot level refer to WP 013 01 
for billet description. 

e. Activities may have more than one librarian [primary/alternate(s)] due to the size of the library or 
operational commitment.  When this occurs, the primary librarian will be the one identified as the POC on 
the activity’s ELMS Customer Account.  (The primary librarian is the CTPL “supervisor/lead,” all other 
librarians assigned to CTPL are alternates.) 

f. Utilize figure 4 for the CTPL billet description/assignment form.  Do not purge billet description unless 
responsibilities have changed.  In that case, keep the initial billet description along with the new billet 
description. 

4-4 DISPERSED TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY (DTPL) is subordinate to and under the 
direct management control of an activity’s CTPL.  DTPL may be collocated within a shop, work center, or 
office code at an activity.  DTPL functions are typically performed as a collateral duty by an employee of 
an applicable shop, work center, or office code.  Any number of DTPLs may fall under an activity’s CTPL.  

a. Work center (W/C) or Depot supervisors are responsible for informing the CTPL of additional manual 
requirements and replacement of damaged manuals. 

b. Dispersed library functions shall be assigned and performed as outlined in paragraph 24-1. 

c. Dispersed libraries will be responsible for the storage, update, and user availability of the 
publications issued to them.

d. Personnel assigned to a dispersed library, should be retained in the billet a minimum of six months.  
Personnel assigned as DTPL at Depot level refer to WP 013 01 for billet description. 

4-5 NAVAL WARFARE PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY provides for central administration of Naval Warfare 
Publication (NWP) including aircraft tactical manuals (NTTP 3-22 Series). 

a. When the CTPL controls the NATOPS/Tactical manual distribution, inventory control of the NATOPS 
and or the tactical manuals will require special management attention with the unit’s NATOPS Officer. 

b. The guidelines for the organization and administration of the NWP Library are contained in the NTRP 
1-01, The Navy Warfare Library.  

5-1 TRAINING 

5-2 Personnel assigned to a CTPL shall receive indoctrination and continuous training in library 
operation.  In accordance with COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, it is mandatory all CTPL librarians attend 
the Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training Unit (CNATTU) Aeronautical Technical Publications 
Library (ATPL)  Management Course as discussed in paragraph 5-4 below.  Follow-on training is required 
and includes training received during all types of inspections, on-the-job training, training conducted by 
TPSs, NATEC’s CTPL Symposiums, and attendance at other library management related training. 

5-3 Training includes On Job Training (OJT) with formal schooling available.  The training of dispersed 
librarians is a responsibility of the CTPL librarian/command or the appropriate Departments at the Depots.  
Dispersed librarian training, including the clerk in the Operations Department will be provided at least 
quarterly. 

5-4 Information on formal schools may be obtained from Center for Naval Aviation Technical Training 
Unit (CNATTU).  For quota information utilize the Catalog of Naval training Courses (CANTRAC) or use 
Enterprise Naval Training Reservation System (eNTRS) at https://main.prod.cetars.training.navy.mil. 

6-1 CONTROL OF PUBLICATIONS 

6-2 A record in the TMAPS ELMS will be used to control all publications media managed by CTPL.  The 
NATEC ELMS Program is the primary management tool utilized for controlling technical media managed 
by CTPL librarians (WP 010 00).  The ELMS database arranges the entries alphanumerically for all 
manuals without regard to the originator or the media. 

6-3 For activities not under the direction of COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, recording of technical 
directives (TDs)  in the ELMS database is optional. 

6-4 NAVAIR 17-20 series manuals issued on Metrology Program (METPRO) CD disks will require a 
CTPL database record only on the NA 17-35MTL-1 and Instrument Calibration Procedures (ICP) disks 
identified in WP 006 00. 

6-5 Department of Defense (DOD) publications, Military Specification and Standards, and commercial 
manuals that are used in the performance of maintenance although not assigned NAVAIR numbers (WP 
006 00) shall be entered into the ELMS Program.  Commercial manuals, when provided with new 
equipment, will be delivered to the CTPL for entry in the ELMS Program. 

6-6 NAVSUP publications do not come under the management control of the activity CTPL unless 
distribution is controlled by the CTPL.  Management control of NAVSUP publications normally falls under 
the control of the activity Supply/Material Control Officer. 

a. NAVSUP Weapons Systems Support (NAVAL Supply WSS) Philadelphia publications are used by 
material control for ordering/reference purposes and these publications can be retained as a single copy 
issue, but only in Material Control. 

b. Automatic distribution, including quantities for NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia publications, is provided 
by way of the SNDL system.  Additional information on how to obtain NAVSUP publications is

furnished in WP 006 00, while more information on NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia publications is provided 
in WP 009 00. 

c. NAVAIR related manuals such as Illustrated Parts Breakdowns (IPBs) held by Material Control come 
under the management controls as established by the activity CTPL. 

6-7 NATOPS/Tactical manuals, when maintained in the NWP library in the Operations Department, 
normally come under the management control of the activity’s NATOPS Officer vice the CTPL. 

7-1 AUTHORIZED TECHNICAL MANUALS 

7-2 A Technical Manual Source Data Record (TMSDR) is only used by TPDR Disposition Authorities 
within the JDRS (See WP 015 00).  Under no circumstances shall TMSDRs be distributed to authorize or 
perform maintenance. 

7-3 Authorized technical publications for use in support of operations and maintenance of aeronautical 
weapon systems and equipment may include:  

● COMNAVAIRSYSCOM approved military specification technical manuals.  
● COMNAVAIRSYSCOM approved, numbered, and issued commercial off-the-shelf technical 

publications.  

7-4 When a requiring activity is unable to locate the applicable COMNAVAIRSYSCOM approved 
technical publication or determines such a publication is questionable (for example, an advance technical 
manual also known as “Preliminary or Pre-Final” manual released with intent for interim use only), the 
activity shall send an assistance request letter, including all pertinent information about the manual via the 
chain of command, to Director, NATEC Code 6.8.5, PO BOX 357031, SAN DIEGO CA 92135-7031.  
Correspondence may also be sent to nani_customerservice@navy.mil. 

7-5 NATEC Code 6.8.5 shall respond directly to the originator, with appropriate information to other 
involved commands (if known) within 30 calendar days of receiving the request for assistance. 

7-6 Refer to COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, chapter 7 for further guidance on Pre-Final Technical Data. 

8-1 CONTROL OF CLASSIFIED PUBLICATIONS 

8-2 Close coordination between the CTPL librarian and the command’s Security Manager is essential.  
Procedures will be established for the dissemination of classified material originated or received by the 
CTPL (WP 005 00). 

9-1 DESCRIPTION OF NAVAL AIR TECHNICAL DATA AND ENGINEERING SERVICE CENTER 
ENHANCED LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROGRAM DATABASE (See WP 010 00) 

10-1 RETENTION OF ENHANCED LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROGRAM FILES 

10-2 ACTIVE TECHNICAL MANUAL RECORDS.  A record is maintained on each copy of each manual 
controlled by the CTPL until it has been deleted from the library.  This file shall consist of all manuals 
media controlled by the CTPL librarian including cancelled manuals retained for equipment being 
maintained in activity and manuals received in digital format (WP 010 00). 

10-3 HISTORY (DEAD) FILE.  Records deleted from the Active File are placed in the History (Dead) File 
within the ELMS Program.  This file contains all those manuals deleted from the active files due to 
removal from the CTPL or manual is revised.  These records will be retained within the ELMS Program for 
a minimum of 1 year.  The ELMS Program annotates the reason for removal from the active database. 

● If as the result of update this will be shown. 
● If as the result of an update by the CTPL librarian, it may be entered as: “CANCELLED,” 

“OBSOLETE,” or “NOT REQUIRED.”  

10-4 DECK LOAD CHANGE.  Upon a change of manual requirements, usually because of a change of 
aircraft Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) or equipment, active file records affected may be deleted from the  



NAVAIR 00-25-100 013 00

ELMS Program after work center audits have been completed to ensure that the TMs are no longer held 
in the work center.  ADRL requirements shall be updated at this time by the CTPL. 

11-1 CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY FILES ON AUTOMATED DATA 
PROCESSING SYSTEMS 

11-2 When the librarian processes the receipt of the TM in the ELMS program, enter in the date the TM 
was received (CTPL Rcpt block) and issued by CTPL (Issue Date block).  The issue date block must be 
the actual date the TM was issued to CTPL or the applicable work center. 

11-3  Storage and handling of classified information shall be accomplished in accordance with the 
requirements of SECNAV M-5510.36.  Entry of management information into the ELMS Program on 
classified manuals is required for tracking purposes the same as for unclassified manuals. 

12-1  INVENTORY CONTROL 

12-2  All forms of TM data and changes including TDs must be marked for proper inventory control.  TM 
data maintained electronically must be Functional Area Management (FAM) approved software that 
allows compliance of the established guidelines discussed in the following paragraphs.  Contact activity’s 
Information Assurance Manager (IAM) for assistance identifying approved software.  A locally procured 
stamp shall be used on each type of TM media.  The stamp should include, as a minimum, the following 
items of identification: 

● Activity 
● Copy Number 
● Location 

12-3  The stamp will be placed on the title page that identifies the date of the publication.  For media such 
as CDs, IETMs, or microfiche place the stamp on the container using a mailing label.  For TDs, the stamp 
shall be placed on the first page and include the date it was received.  Control and distribution at depot 
level is maintained by workload control documentation.  For IRACs, the stamp shall be placed on the first 
page. 

12-4  The CTPL librarian will establish a simple numbering system as copy numbers for all manuals under 
CTPL control.  The CTPL shall issue a quarterly NATEC ELMS Program Work Center Locator Listing for 
all work centers.  The Locator Listing is by definition the readily accessible listing of publications and their 
locations. 

13-1 BINDERS FOR PUBLICATIONS 

13-2  NAVAIR TMs and directives are drilled with three large and two small holes.  The three large holes 
fit the posts of the special NAVAIR publication binders.  The two small holes allow for use of the standard 
three-ring loose-leaf binder.  The specially designed NAVAIR binders are available through the U.S. 
General Services Administration (GSA) Advantage Website 
(https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/main/start_page.do) or via open purchase from Specialty 
Loose Leaf, Cabot Street, Holyoke MA 01040, telephone number 1-800-227-3623 or website 
www.specialitylooseleaf.com.  Part Numbers for the binders are:  

● 2” Binder – 30 3519

14-1  STORAGE AND IDENTIFICATION OF TECHNICAL DATA 

14-2  Each manual/directive received will be placed in an appropriate binder or information technology (IT) 
repository.  Classified Publications shall be stored in accordance with SECNAV M-5510.36.  CTPLs are 
not required to maintain “master copy” of all TMs maintained in the activity. 

14-3  When more than one manual or type of directive is placed in the same binder, the lowest NAVAIR 
manual or type directive number shall appear first on the spine, followed by the term “thru” and ending 
with the highest manual or directive (figure 5). 

14-4  After filing the above documents the binders are stored on shelves, filing cabinets, or other 
appropriate methods as follows: 

a. Manuals shall be arranged alphanumerically for NAVAIR publications.  Manuals should not be in 
different areas around the CTPL but in NAVAIR number sequence and all together. 

b. TDs shall be filed by specific type (paragraph 20-1). 

c. Manuals other than NAVAIR may be filed in separate binders under an appropriate general heading. 

d. MRC decks shall be stored in appropriate card index containers in alphanumerical order.  

e. Instructions and notices shall be filed in separate binders in Standard Subject Identification Code 
(SSIC) sequence.  An additional breakdown by major echelon, i.e., type commander, wing, etc., is also 
authorized. 

f. Non-standard size manuals should be stored in appropriate containers, conveniently located for 
ready use and the location noted in the ELMS Program database. 

g. CD-ROMs shall be arranged alphanumerically in CD-ROM number sequence and stored in an 
appropriate storage cabinet or container. 

h. The local command shall assign the appropriate department to ensure assigned Portable Electronic 
Maintenance Aids (PEMAs) are operated and maintained in a secure environment and meet DoD 
Information Assurance (IA) and information system security requirements. 

15-1 INCORPORATION OF UPDATES TO NAVAIR TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS (Refer to WP 012 00) 

16-1  CHANGE ENTRY CERTIFICATION RECORD 

16-2  The Change Entry Certification Record (CECR) is used as a record by the CTPL librarian to ensure 
updates to manuals, specifically paper/hard copy, have been issued to and incorporated into dispersed 
libraries.  The CTPL librarian shall establish procedures whereby updates to TMs are picked up or 
delivered on a daily basis.  The CECR is generated by the ELMS Program.  

16-3  The CECR is a receipt for: 

a. The issuance of an update to be incorporated by the holder of a manual, specifically paper/hard 
copy. 

b. The CTPL indicating an update has been issued for incorporation to a specific manual held by a 
designated work center. 

c. Ensuring old/discarded pages of a manual are accounted for in accordance with locally established 
procedures. 

16-4  A CECR is initiated on all updates to TM data media issued to the dispersed libraries.  The CTPL 
librarian will incorporate the update into the CTPL copy as soon as practical.  Use of the CECR by the 
CTPL is not required on CTPL copies unless someone other than the CTPL (i.e. an appropriate QAR) is 
incorporating the basic/revision, change, or RAC/IRAC/ERAC.  If there are multiple librarians working in 
the library the use of the CECR is a good way to keep track of who actually incorporated the update.

16-5  If discrepancies are identified (such as missing pages, poor quality printing, etc.), the update copies 
will not be issued to the dispersed libraries.  Additional guidance and assistance shall be requested from 
the QA division supervisor or appropriate depot department. 

16-6  The CTPL shall train the dispersed librarian(s) in the use of the CECR and the proper methods of 
making the various types of changes to publications media held. 

16-7  CHANGE ENTRY CERTIFICATION RECORD FILE PART 1.  The CTPL shall establish a CECR 
tickler file containing the following: 

a. A 2-day file of CECR PART 1s for IRACs and RACs.  Due to the critical nature of the update, IRACs 
and RACs shall be incorporated by the work center within 2 working days of receipt from the CTPL.   

b. A 5-day file of CECR PART 1s for formal changes and routine revisions/notices.  Formal changes 
and routine revisions and notices shall be incorporated by the work center within 5 working days of 
receipt from the CTPL. 

16-8  CTPL librarian training of dispersed librarian(s) shall outline the procedures of when and where to 
pick up the CECR and manual(s) consistent with the time limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph. 

16-9  This tickler file is a suspense record of CECR PART 1s issued to the dispersed libraries along 
with the appropriate manual.  The CTPL librarian should set the CECR file up sequentially by due date to 
facilitate a daily review of outstanding updates.  The CECR PART 1 is removed from the tickler file and 
discarded upon receipt of the completed CECR PART 2, indicating applicable action has been completed. 

16-10  CHANGE ENTRY CERTIFICATION RECORD FILE PART 2.  The CTPL librarian shall establish a 
file of CECR PART 2s maintained in dispersed library sequence.  The CECR PART 2 shall be returned to 
the CTPL along with cancelled publications or superseded pages, indicating completion of the applicable 
update to the manual media.  Appropriate security measures will be adhered to when returning classified 
manuals media to the CTPL. 

16-11  After proper annotation in the ELMS Program by the CTPL, the CECR PART 2 file shall be 
maintained in dispersed library sequence.  CECR Part 2 file on manual media without discrepancies may 
be disposed of after successful completion of the next Quarterly Audit conducted on the dispersed library.  
The audit report on manual media with discrepancies will be including in the CECR PART 2, identifying 
the individual who incorporated the update. 

16-12  These reports are retained in the CTPL Transaction File for one year. 

17-1 REPRODUCTION PAPER COPIES OF UNCLASSIFIED PUBLICATIONS 

17-2 Source of material for reproduction is an authorized CTPL copy of the publication.  A digital manual 
downloaded from the NATEC website or received from NATEC on a CD-ROM would be considered an 
authorized copy.  Requirement for reproduction is to replace missing or damaged portions of an 
authorized copy of a manual or a requirement for an additional copy.  Publications annotated with 
“Missing Pages or Changes” during an audit of a work center may be restored from the digital data 
available from NATEC. 

17-3 All reproduced copies will be managed in the same manner as the original by entering them into the 
ELMS Program and affixing appropriate library stamps.  The copy held by the dispersed library must, as a 
minimum, be comprised of: the Title Page, all referenced material, all of the Numerical Index of Effective 
Work Packages/Pages, all applicable Notices and Rapid Action Changes, and the Work Packages or 
pages desired by the WCS. 

17-4 A copy number will be assigned and the Remarks field of the ELMS Program will be annotated with: 
“This manual consists of the Title page, Numerical Index pages XXXX, and Work Package XXX XX, 
pages XXX to XXX.  This is a complete manual for audit purposes; the remainder of this manual is 
maintained on the NATEC website, JKCS, or CD-ROM maintained by the activity.”

17-6 An activity may reproduce portions of TMs that are non-routine for single use and control them.  The 
reproduced single use is control as follows: 

a. A QA Subject Matter Expert (SME) shall review all printed material for completeness and ensure 
proper control. 

b. Identify the reproduced TM in the corrective action block in Naval Aviation Logistics Command 
Management Information System (NALCOMIS)/on the Visual Information Display System/Maintenance  
Action Form (VIDS/MAF) 4790/60 or work order by annotating the TM number and specific pages that 
were printed.  Example, NA 01-1A-35, dtd 01 Aug 05, pgs 1-1 thru 1-10, total of 10 pgs. 

c. The WCS shall ensure that all printed material is accounted for and destroyed upon completion of a 
maintenance action per procedures outlined in this TM.  The supervisor’s signature in NALCOMIS/on the 
VIDS/MAF or work order indicates the printed material is verified current, accounted for, and destroyed. 

17-7 If printing a manual directly from the NATEC website, be advised that the hyperlinks (e.g. see IRAC 
X) will not be visible in the printed copy unless the individual printer setting is set in accordance with the 
established procedures described by the Adobe Reader version utilized by the activity.  Select the “Printer 
Icon” from the PDF file (do not use the file menu to print) (See figure 6). 

a. When the print screen appears, the following procedures apply as appropriate to the Adobe Version 
in use by the activity: 

 For Adobe Pro 10.0, some errors exist in printing PDF files.  Contact NATEC Customer Service 
on trouble printing from the website if the paper copy received through Naval Logistics Library is 
corrupted. 

 For Adobe Reader 7.0 – 9.0, in the upper right corner under the “Comments and Forms” drop

browser application in order to save the setting for future use.  If these settings are not saved through the 
Adobe Reader, you will have to change the setting each time before printing. 

c. If there are any questions or need assistance, contact one of the TPSs at 
nani_customerservice@navy.mil.  

18-1 CANCELLED TECHNICAL MANUALS MEDIA 

18-2 TM data may be cancelled due to the following reasons: 

a. TM data may be cancelled by other superseding manuals and/or IETM program.  Supersedure 
notices on the title page of superseding manual identifies superseded/cancelled manuals. 

b. Manuals may also be cancelled without being superseded by other manuals.  Included in this 
category are manuals supporting aircraft or equipment no longer in the NAVAIR inventory. 

c. A Reliability Centered Maintenance Program (RCM) within NAVAIR has resulted in manuals being 
cancelled when it was determined it was not “economically feasible” to perform some levels of preventive 
maintenance upon the equipment. 

18-3 Cancelled manuals, without proper authorization for continued usage, should be removed from the 
work centers and their use discontinued.  Authorization to utilize manuals that have been cancelled 
should be requested via an activity`s type wing and/or type commander (TYCOM). 

a. Further recommend activities contact the Logistic Element Manager (LEM) or Data Manager (DM) for 
the cancelled manuals in question, as the LEM/DM will have information on why the manual was 
cancelled.  Contact information for the LEM and DM can be found under the “POC/LEM” section of the 
publication information located in TMAPS.

publications via email to nani_customerservice@navy.mil. 

(4) All cancelled manuals provided by NATEC, regardless of media, will be stamped with a 
“CANCELLED” watermark on the title page. 

19-1  NAVAIR TECHNICAL DIRECTIVES 

19-2 The Technical Directive Reporting System (TDRS) is the only authorized medium for directing the 
accomplishment and recording of modifications and one-time inspections of NAVAIR accepted 
equipment.  COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 contains additional information on maintaining TDs in the 
CTPL.  NAVAIR 00-25-300 is the management and procedures manual for the NAVAIR Technical 
Directive system. 

20-1  MANAGEMENT OF TECHNICAL DIRECTIVES  

20-2  The CTPL will maintain a master file of applicable TDs.  Copies of TDs properly stamped, issued, 
and controlled by the CTPL librarian are authorized for use in work centers.  

NOTE 

Applicable TD changes and bulletins which affect Aviation Life Support System 
(ALSS) equipment and clothing will be filed in a separate binder in the ALSS work 
center (on a controlled basis).  Refer to WP 012 00, paragraph 8-1 for annotating TDs 
to applicable paper manuals and CDs.  

20-3  Technical Directives with discovered deficiencies shall be reported as a Category (CAT) 1 Technical 
Publications Deficiency Report (TPDR) Message or as a CAT 2, 3 or 4 TPDR via Joint Deficiency 
Reporting System (JDRS) (WP 015 00). 

20-4  Activities not under the direction of COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, the following procedures are 
recommendations.  For activities under the direction of COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, the Naval Aviation 
Maintenance Program (NAMP) procedures take precedence over the following: 

a. Upon receipt of a TD, request SME Quality Assurance Representative (QAR)/Collateral Duty Quality 
Assurance Representative (CDQAR) review TD for applicability to assigned equipment.  This may 
necessitate use of other work centers within the activity. 

b. If TD is applicable, the CTPL librarian shall apply the control stamp (which will also include the date 
received) to those TD copies received (figure 7).  Enter receipt of the TD into the ELMS Program for the 
master copy and any additional copies located in the work center.  Ensure filename of each TD entered 
into the ELMS database has the same file naming convention as the filename used by NATEC, for 
example FA-18-AFC-125-A1. 

 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 013 00

c. Route a copy of the TD (utilizing the TD Routing and Tracking Sheet provided in 
COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2) for continued processing.  

20-5  Requisition all required TDs, revisions and amendments.  If copies of TDs cannot be obtained from 
NATEC, other squadrons, supporting FRCs or requisitioned via normal supply channels, Organizational 
level activities shall request TDs from cognizant wing.  Additional guidelines are provided in paragraphs 
21-1 and 22-1. 

20-6  The requirement to maintain paper TDs is optional.  Master paper copies of historical TDs not active 
on DECKPLATE TDRS are not required to be maintained by CTPL.  Historical TDs are not required to be 
retained in active ELMS database as long as CTPL has access to the NATEC website. 

20-7  If the master copy of the TD is in paper format, master copies shall be filed in binders by T/M/S, 
oldest on bottom to most current on top.  Additional paper copies not issued to work centers shall be 
placed in a pending file.  Random duplication of TDs must be avoided.  Often TDs will be issued as 
Amendments, Revisions etc.  The CTPL librarian shall obtain and provide additional copies of TDs as 
needed to support detachments of the parent unit.  Positive control must be maintained by the CTPL. 

20-8  Annotate page 1 of the TD maintained by the CTPL librarian or use of the NATEC ELMS Program to 
account for location of other copies.  This will maintain positive control.  When TD copies are returned, 
update the applicable blocks on the TD records and move the record to the historical (dead) file in ELMS.  
An appropriate annotation will be made on the master file copy, i.e., “VP-60, 010, returned 11/24/04”.  
The CTPL librarian will dispose of paper copies in accordance with local procedures established for 
disposal of unclassified TDs.   

20-9  TD records in ELMS moved from the active database to historical (dead) file will remain in history 
(dead) file for one year to ensure digital historical data is accessible.  The TD history (dead) file records 
shall not be deleted by the CTPL librarian from the history (dead) file.  Deletion of TD history records will 
permanently remove this record(s) and issue/return data from historical (dead) file. 

20-10 Upon receipt by the CTPL, the Weekly Summary for Issued Technical Directives message shall be 
processed and retained for reference for a period of six months.  The file of TD summaries may be 
retained in either paper or digital format.  

21-1 TECHNICAL DIRECTIVE REQUISITIONING PROCEDURES 

21-2 CLASSIFICATION OF FORMAL AND MESSAGE TECHNICAL DIRECTIVES.  Formal TDs are 
assigned stock numbers and initially distributed on the NATEC website for viewing then a hard copy is 
sent out by Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) if the TD meets one or more of the following conditions 
below: 

a. TDs more than 100 pages. 

b. TDs with color content are determined to be a safety factor for TD implementation. 

c. TDs contain foldouts. 

NOTE 

Due to time constraints of TD compliance, it is recommended to directly print a copy 
from the NATEC website.  If connectivity is an issue you can find the formal TDs listed 
in the NAVSUP P2003 and can be ordered via Military Standard Requisitioning and 
Issue Procedure/Naval Logistics Library (MILSTRIP/NLL). 

21-3 Message TDs are distributed via Naval Message System by NAVAIR Address Indicator Group (AIG) 
and then posted to NATEC’s website for viewing.  Activities should submit a request for any message TD 
not posted on the NATEC website within a timely manner by submitting requests to NATEC Customer 
Service Support’s email address (nani_customerservice@navy.mil) or call commercial (619)545-1888, or 
DSN: 735-1888 or FAX commercial (619)545-2722 or DSN 735-2722.

23-1 CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY TRANSACTION FILE 

23-2 The CTPL Transaction File must be created virtually at the very beginning of the establishing a 
CTPL, the file provides a central collection point for the documents that will be sent to the Quality 
Assurance Division relative to manuals being provided to the activity.  It’s a collective term for all of the 
records and files that represent the work carried out by the CTPL.  Some of the records and files will be 
stored on the computer as digital files, some will be hard copy paper, others will be completed audits, still 
others correspondence files or training reports. 

23-3 The CTPL will maintain the following minimum files (records): 

a. Most recent copy of the ADRL CD set.  ADRL CD set must be maintained by activities that deploy 
and/or that support detachments, and ordered once a year at a minimum.  The ADRL CD is ordered 
through CD On-Line Ordering (see WP 009 00) on the NATEC website Table of Contents (TOC).  
Maintaining ADRL CDs for CONUS shore based activities and at the depot level is optional. 

b. For non-ELMS users, maintain the most recent e-mail from NATEC acknowledging processing of 
ADRL and an annotated copy of the returned ADRL file and annotated copy of the Audit Summary.  This 
is not applicable to TMAPS ELMS users. 

NOTE 

At a minimum, make a copy of CTPL’s ADRL Report from TMAPS ELMS database 
annually (see WP 010 00). 

c. All correspondence on automatic distribution requirements for the past year.  Technical Publications 
Library Information Sheets (TPLIS) will be maintained in the correspondence area of the CTPL 
Transaction File.  Also, email traffic between the activity and NATEC Distribution may be retained. 

d. CTPL audits will be retained for one year.  Dispersed library audit results shall be retained by the 
CTPL, in work center order, for four consecutive audits (one year).  They shall be reviewed for repeat 
discrepancies.  These files will help identify trends. 

e. Annotated CSEC (COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2) for the CTPL and DTPL audits. 

f. A publication requisition log consisting of: 

 A log identifying all pertinent information on outstanding requisitions (WP 009 00). 

 Record of current status information. 

 The Outstanding Requisitions may be resident in the ELMS Program for those activities using the 
ELMS Requisition Log (WP 009 00). 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 013 00

g. A copy of the billet description/assignment form for CTPL (figure 4), DTPL (figure 8) and a copy of 
indoctrination syllabus for each DTPL (figure 9).  If Advanced Skills Management (ASM) is utilized, paper 
copies are not required to be maintained.  Access to ASM must be available during inspections and to 
CTPLs to verify completion of requirements during audits/inspections. 

h. Completed DTPL training attendance rosters.  Optionally, training for Supervisors and DTPLs may 
be documented using the CSEC Overview during quarterly audits. 

i. A current copy of the ELMS Program COMPLETE LISTING of manuals.  This is often a “working 
document”, used by CTPLs to enter the update information during periods of inaccessibility to ELMS 
before entering it into the ELMS Program upon regaining access and may be maintained electronically.  
Recommend printing or saving electronic copy monthly. 

j. Non-ELMS users maintain a current copy of the ELMS Program HISTORY (DEAD) FILE.  This can 
be either a hard copy or an electronic file.  This is not a requirement for TMAPS ELMS users. 

k. File of outstanding and completed CECRs for the past quarter.  These will be used during the 
coming quarter to compare with the work center manuals during the quarterly audit. 

l. Annotated Weekly IRAC and Technical Manual Trackers Summary messages for the past six 
months.  

m. Annotated Weekly TD Summary messages for past six months. 

n. JTDI Administrator’s Guide (if utilizing JTDI). 

o. JTDI User’s Guide (if utilizing JTDI) 

p. User’s Logistic Support Summary (ULSS) for Portable Electronic Maintenance Aid (PEMA) 
Handbook. 

24-1 DISPERSED TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY OPERATION 

24-2 Dispersed libraries fall under the management control of the CTPL or under the department they 
service at the Depots.  DTPLs shall be recommended jointly by the appropriate WCS/ Division Officer and 
designated in writing by the QA Officer.  The CTPL custodian or responsible Depot Department shall be 
responsible for providing training and assistance to both the work center/depot supervisors and the 
dispersed librarians.  Such training will be provided at least quarterly. 

24-3 Work Center/Depot Data Center Supervisors shall: 

a. Ensure dispersed libraries maintain only the required number of copies of applicable manuals on 
hand.  Avoid excessive “stock piling” and ordering of manuals. 

b. Ensure all manual requests (that are part of dispersed library) are submitted to the CTPL for 
procurement. 

c. Provide the necessary guidance, supervision and support necessary to manage the dispersed 
library. 

d. Establish procedures within each work center to identify the location of all manuals held using the 
Locator Listing option in the ELMS Program. 

e. Ensure the DTPL is assigned in writing using figure 8 and has completed training requirements prior 
to assignment (figure 9).  Do not purge billet description unless responsibilities have changed.  In that 
case, keep the initial description along with the new billet description. 

24-4 The CTPL uses the NATEC ELMS Program to locate manuals under its control.  Dispersed libraries 
require only a visible, readily accessible list for publications and their location.  This listing is provided in 
the ELMS Program. 

24-5 Ensure that when manuals are no longer required, they are returned to the CTPL with justification for 
the return.  The CTPL will dispose of the manual(s), annotate the ELMS Program, and maintain a record 
of these manuals.

25-1 STORAGE PROCEDURES FOR PUBLICATIONS IN DISPERSED TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS 
LIBRARIES 

25-2 In the dispersed libraries, because of the multiplicity of copies of the same manual media, the 
composition of the binders will be left to the discretion of the work center supervisor.  It may be necessary 
to have several binders, one at each workstation, with the same set of manuals, enabling more than one 
worker access to the manuals.  Sets of Maintenance Requirement Card (MRC) decks, two or more copies 
of the troubleshooting manual or other media are usually the reason for not having the manuals in the 
same storage criteria as used in the CTPL. 

25-3 While the CTPL uses the ELMS Program to locate TMs under its control, dispersed libraries require 
only a visible, readily accessible list for manuals and their location.  This listing is provided as the Locator 
Listing with primary emphasis must be on ready accessibility of the manual to the user.  CD-ROMs shall 
be arranged alphanumerically in CD-ROM number sequence and stored in an appropriate storage 
cabinet or container with the CD-ROM end label readily visible. 

26-1 BINDERS UTILIZED IN DISPERSED TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARIES 

26-2 Binders utilized in Dispersed Libraries are similar to those used by the CTPL.  The numbering 
system for NAVAIR TMs and directives contained in binders used by the dispersed libraries will be 
identical to the CTPL.  Within the binders, the manuals shall be arranged alphanumerically by NAVAIR 
publication number (figure 5). 

27-1 CLASSIFIED PUBLICATIONS STORAGE 

27-2 Classified publications storage will be in accordance with WP 005 00 and local procedures 
established by the command and the CTPL. 

28-1 CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY REQUIRED DIRECTIVES, MANUALS AND 
DOCUMENTS 

28-2 The CTPL requires specific directives and manuals to assist in operating a library.  Figure 10 shows 
the minimum requirements.  Activities are encouraged to increase their files as necessary to properly 
support maintenance of assigned weapons system/equipment.  These may be maintained in paper or 
digital format.  Cross reference to appropriate Universal Resource Locator (URL) is also authorized.

1-1 OVERVIEW  

1-2 This work package (WP) is applicable to Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) Depot (level 3) libraries only.  
For all other organizational, intermediate, and depot libraries refer to WP 013 00. 

1-3 Local instructions promulgated by the FRCs for the Depot Level library activities performed at the 
FRCs/In-Service Support Center (FRC/ISSC) shall ensure compliance with the intent of WP 013 00 and 
the requirements described in this WP. 

2-1 TYPES OF LIBRARIES 

2-2 To be effective, the technical publications library must be a centrally managed function.  Therefore, 
an FRC’s library is based on its size and organizational construct.  Dispersed libraries, satellite libraries, 
and library service areas may be established as required, however, all shall function under direct control 
of the FRC’s Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL). 

2-3 FRC CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY librarians coordinates and manage  FRC’s 
technical manual (TM) functions and shall be responsible for the analysis of TM requirements, 
procurement of documents, receipt and local distribution, security compliance, maintenance, and update 
of all TMs under their cognizant and applicable to the FRC.  CTPLs may have a number of Dispersed 
Publications Libraries (DTPLs), Satellite Libraries, or Libraries Service Areas (LSA) under their 
management control. 

2-4 FRC DISPERSED TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY.  DTPLs are subordinate to and under 
the direct management control of an FRC’s CTPL.  DTPLs are collocated within an FRC shop, work 
center, or office code.  Day-to-day DTPL functions are performed as a collateral duty by an employee of 
the applicable shop, work center, or office code.  Any number of DTPLs may fall under an FRC’s CTPL.  
In some cases, DTPL may be subordinate to Satellite Librarians or LSAs. 

2-5 SATELLITE LIBRARY.  A Satellite Library is established and managed in accordance with the 
procedures described in this manual. Satellite Library is subordinate to and under the direct management 
control of an activity or site’s Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL).  Satellite Library is an 
extension of but geographically removed from a Fleet Readiness Center’s (FRC’s) Central Technical

Publications Library (CTPL), e.g., a Satellite Library located at an activity or site different from the 
cognizant CTPL.  Day-to-day Satellite Library functions are generally not performed as a collateral duty. 

2-6 LIBRARY SERVICE AREA (LSA).  LSA is established and managed in accordance with the 
procedures described in this manual.  LSA is subordinate to and under the direct management control of 
an FRC’s Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL).  LSA is typically formed by logically grouping 
DTPLs for convenience and efficiency, e.g., grouping all DTPLs in the same building or grouping several 
buildings in close proximity.  In some cases a LSA may be subordinate to the Satellite Library.  Day-to-
day LSA functions are generally not performed as a collateral duty. 

3-1 RESPONSIBILITIES 

3-2 Activity’s Commanding Officer is responsible for the development, establishment, and operation of 
technical library services in support of local operations and maintenance.  The AIR 6.8 Aviation 
Readiness and Resource Analysis Department is responsible for implementing and carrying out policies 
and procedures to effectively maintain an aeronautical technical library. 

3-3 Management of the FRC Depot Library is a function of the AIR-6.8.5 Logistics Product Data 
Customer Service Branch.  The technical library’s responsibilities include functions and tasks as follows: 

a. Maintain a CTPL, which is adequate to complete the assigned functions of the activity.  Retention of 
master copies of publications within the CTPL is optional. 

b. Requisition, receive, initiate screening, review, route, distribute, as necessary, and file all incoming 
technical publications and documents. 

c. Establish technical libraries at point of use to facilitate Depot level operations.  These may be 
dispersed libraries, satellite libraries or LSAs under direct CTPL control. 

d. Establish and maintain a training program for assigned library personnel, including dispersed 
librarians.  For example; Training plans, Training Requirements Worksheets, Individual Development 
Plans, Individual Qualification Records or Personnel Qualification Systems (PQS) may be used to satisfy 
this requirement. 

e. Develop an automatic verification program using the guidance provided in WP 014 01. 

f. Establish and maintain a program to distribute data to dispersed libraries.  This includes Local 
Engineering Directives (LEDs), NAVAIR, Army, Air Force or other agency aeronautical technical data. 

g. Develop and maintain a program for classified technical data receipt, stowage, distribution, inventory, 
and disposition.  This may be paper, electronic or a combination thereof. 

h. Establish and maintain a program to audit the CTPL annually and dispersed libraries quarterly (WP 
014 01), as a minimum.  In the case where satellite libraries are established under direct control of the 
CTPL, those libraries will be audited following the quarterly schedule as dispersed libraries are audited. 

i. Develop an effective checklist so that discrepancies identified during audits can be identified and 
corrective action noted.  Refer to COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 CSEC. 

j. Upon receipt of Joint Technical Data Information (JTDI) CD updates, deliver to the local Information 
Technology (IT) service provider for immediate loading onto the JTDI Server.  Activities with JTDI Mid-
Tier servers or Mid-Tier services that are automatically updated from the JTDI Top-Tier servers will 
coordinate with the local IT service provider to ensure that updates are scheduled no less than on a 
weekly basis. 

k. Quality Assurance (QA) Officers, Division Officers and key supervisors, i.e., QA Chief, Work Center 
Supervisors (WCS) and FRC Supervisors, must become involved and knowledgeable of library 
operations in order to effectively communicate customer requirements to ensure FRC operations are fully 
supported.

l. FRC technical library personnel may consist of Civil Service and/or Contractor Support Services 
(CSS).  It is critically importance that assigned personnel have the necessary supervision and support 
required to ensure all facets of library management are correctly functioning. 

(1) FRC technical library personnel are permanently assigned personnel and will be assigned duties 
consistent with their Position Descriptions (PDs) or Statements of Work (SOW) for CSS personnel.  
Minimum billet assignment lengths do not apply to Civil Service personnel or CSS personnel as these 
positions do not have obligation limits. 

(2) FRC library operations may function under the Most Efficient Organization (MEO) construct 
where personnel performing library duties may not be assigned directly to the competency providing 
technical authority oversight.  In such cases the competency providing oversight will be responsible for 
policies, procedures, and deviation requests relating to such responsibilities.  The executing competency 
or CSS will provide the labor to operate and manage library support services in compliance with policies 
and procedures set forth and will be responsible for discrepancies relating to the operation of the 
technical libraries. 

m. Technical Publications Specialists (TPSs) (WP 003 00) are available to assist the user community in 
any problem area related to technical publication libraries.  The use of the TPS is encouraged, since they 
are a vital link between Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC), the supply 
system and the user community.  Problems and difficult situations can be minimized or for all concerned 
through the prompt and effective utilization of TPS.

requires specific permissions. 

6-1 UPDATING NAVAL AIR TECHNICAL DATA AND ENGINEERING SERVICE CENTER USER 
ACCOUNT 

6-2 When a new primary/alternate librarian assumes the responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the 
CTPL, one of the first tasks to accomplish is update the individual's "User Account" in the NATEC 
website, and complete the information in the “Customer Account” in the Enhanced Library Management 
System (ELMS) (if on ELMS).  This assists NATEC in contacting the current primary librarian with any 
questions about the activity's CTPL.  When the new librarian primary/alternate has any questions while 
filling out any of the information in user account (NATEC website) or Customer Account (ELMS) (primary 
librarian completes this information), please contact the closest TPS listed in WP 003 00. 

a. Once in the NATEC website validate/update the following information blocks in "My User Account": 

(1) "User Information" – 

 Users full name 

 Rank/Rate/Grade 

 Company (for example, U.S. Navy, USMC, DOD, etc.) 

 Phone/FAX number 

 Distribution Account Code (DAC) 

 Email Notification (select yes, this will notify you when a new TM on your ADRL is released) 

 Default Bandwidth (High or Low) 
 

(2) "Your Command/Company Information" – 

 Command/Company Information 

 Address 

 Street 

 City, State and Zip Code.  Once this information is correct, click submit. 

NOTE 

Management of the list of personnel associated with the DAC is the responsibility of the 
FRC Technical Library Supervisor.

7-4 When a requiring activity is unable to locate the applicable COMNAVAIRSYSCOM approved 
technical publication or determines such a publication is questionable (for example, an advance technical 
manual also known as “Preliminary or Pre-Final” manual released with intent for interim use only), the 
activity shall send an assistance request letter, including all pertinent information about the manual via the 
chain of command, to Director, NATEC Code 6.8.5, PO BOX 357031, SAN DIEGO CA 92135-7031.  
Correspondence may also be sent to nani_customerservice@navy.mil. 

7-5 NATEC Code 6.8.5 shall respond directly to the originator, with appropriate information to other 
involved commands (if known) within 30 calendar days of receiving the request for assistance. 

7-6 Refer to COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, chapter 7 for further guidance on Pre-Final Technical Data. 

8-1 CONTROL OF PUBLICATIONS 

8-2 A record in the TMAPS ELMS will be used to control all publications media managed by CTPL.  The 
NATEC ELMS program is the primary management tool for CTPLs (WP 010 00).  The ELMS database 
arranges the entries alphanumerically for all manuals without regard to the originator or the media. 

8-3 Activities are encouraged to enter all aeronautical technical data products such as TDs, GEDs, 
Commercial, Air Force, Army, and other DoD agency manuals, etc. for distribution and configuration 
control. 

8-4 The FRC CTPL librarian will route all newly introduced TMs, TDs and any other technical data 
according to their local procedures for screening for applicability, capability, supply assets and work 
center distribution assignments.  CTPL librarians will not assign distribution of technical manuals without 
proper authorization according to their local procedures. 

8-5 NAVAIR 17-20 series manuals issued on Metrology Program (METPRO) CD disks will require a 
ELMS database record only on the NA 17-35MTL-1 and Instrument Calibration Procedures (ICP) disks 
identified in WP 006 00. 

8-6 NAVSUP publications do not come under the management control of the activity CTPL unless 
distribution is controlled by the CTPL librarian.  Management control of NAVSUP publications normally 
falls under the control of the activity Supply/Material Control Officer. 

a. NAVSUP Weapons System Support (Naval Supply WSS) Philadelphia publications are used by 
material control for ordering/reference purposes and these publications can be retained as a single copy 
issue, but only in Material Control. 

b. Automatic distribution, including quantities for NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia publications, is provided 
by way of the Standard Navy Distribution List (SNDL) system.  Additional information on how to obtain 
NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia publications are provided in WP 006 00. 

8-7 Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS)/Tactical Manuals, when 
maintained in the Naval Warfare Publication (NWP) library in the Operations Department, normally come 
under the management control of the activity’s NATOPS Officer vice the CTPL.  NATOPS manuals will 
not automatically show up on the Automatic Distribution Requirements List (ADRL).  The CTPL must 
contact the NATOPS Logistics Element Manager (LEM) in order for NATOPS manuals to appear in the 
ADRL.  Close coordination between the Operations Officer or the appropriate FRC Department Head is 
required to ensure FRC operational requirements are met. 

9-1 CONTROL OF CLASSIFIED PUBLICATIONS 

9-2 Close coordination between the CTPL and the command’s Security Manager is essential.  
Procedures will be established for the dissemination of classified material originated or received by the 
CTPL (WP 005 00). 

9-3 Entry of management information into the ELMS Program on classified manuals is required for 
tracking purposes the same as for unclassified manuals.

controlled by the CTPL until it has been deleted from the library.  This file shall consist of all manuals 
media controlled by the CTPL including cancelled manuals retained for equipment being maintained and 
manuals received in digital format (WP 010 00). 

11-3 HISTORY (DEAD) FILE.  Technical data that has been cancelled or no longer required will be 
annotated as such in the ELMS program files.  These records will be retained for a minimum of one (1) 
year.  The ELMS Program will purge the files reaching the storage expiration date when the Dead File 
Report is run the first time after the expiration of the holding period. 

NOTE 

FRC activities may retain these files indefinitely to support engineering and logistics 
functions, Engineering Investigations (EIs), Acceptance Inspection Deficiency Reports 
(AIDRs), Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDRs), etc. 

12-1 CENTRAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS LIBRARY FILES ON AUTOMATED DATA 
PROCESSING SYSTEMS (See WP 013 00) 

13-1 INVENTORY CONTROL 

13-2 All forms of TM data and changes including TDs must be marked for proper inventory control. 

13-3 A locally procured stamp shall be used on each type of TM media.  The stamp should include, as a 
minimum, the following items of identification: 

● Activity 
● Copy Number 
● Location or Shop 

NOTE 

The stamp may be electronically applied before printing copies of media using the 
stamp feature included in Adobe Acrobat Professional.  Ensure the stamp does not 
cover or obstruct any data content. 

13-4 The stamp will be placed on the title page that identifies the date of the publication. 

a. For media such as CDs, or IETMs place the stamp on the container using a mailing label.  

b. For TDs, the stamp shall be placed on the first page.  Distribution information at Depot level is 
assigned by workload control documentation.  The CTPL is responsible for the distribution, control and 
auditing of the TDs. 

c. For Interim Rapid Action Changes (IRACs), the stamp shall be placed on the first page. 

13-5 CTPL will establish a simple numbering system as copy numbers for all manuals under CTPL 
control.  Copy numbers shall not be reused in the case of a lost manual or document. 

13-6 The CTPL shall issue, or make available, a quarterly locator listing for all work centers.  This listing 
arranges publications and documents in sequence and should be used by the work center as the readily 
accessible listing of publications and their locations. 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 013 01

NOTE 

The locator listing’s primary purpose is to provide an easy to use method to conduct 
inventories and find location information.  Listings may be grouped and/or sorted to fit 
a shop’s particular need, i.e. NAVAIR TMs, Air Force TOs, TDs, LEDs, etc. 

14-1 BINDERS FOR PUBLICATIONS (See WP 013 00) 

15-1 STORAGE AND IDENTIFICATION OF TECHNICAL DATA (See WP 013 00) 

15-2 Due to the unique business model of FRCs, shops may have multiple work centers assigned which 
are in different physical locations with different functions.  Technical data products may be grouped and 
stored according to unique shop/work center functions.  For example, Metrology and Calibration 
(METCAL) work requires TMs, calibration standards, commercial manuals, etc. in which the common data 
element may be part numbers.  Therefore the laboratory may opt to store data in packages with related 
data in part number sequence vice TM sequence.  A locator listing is still required regardless of storage 
arrangement method. 

15-3 Classified Publications shall be stored in accordance with WP 005 00. 

15-4 After filing the above documents the binders are stored on shelves, filing cabinets or other 
appropriate methods as follows: 

a. Manuals shall be arranged alphanumerically for publications.  Manuals should not be in different 
areas around the CTPL but in NAVAIR number sequence and all together. 

b. Technical Directives (TDs) may be filed by specific type or platform in alphanumeric sequence (WP 
013 00). 

c. Manuals other than NAVAIR manuals may be filed in separate binders under an appropriate general 
heading. 

d. MRC decks shall be stored in appropriate containers in alphanumerical order. 

e. Instructions and notices shall be filed in separate binders in Standard Subject Identification Code 
(SSIC) sequence.  An additional breakdown by major echelon, i.e., type commander, wing, etc., is also 
authorized. 

f. Non-standard size manuals should be stored in appropriate containers, conveniently located for 
ready use and the location noted in the ELMS program database. 

g. CD-ROMs shall be arranged alphanumerically in CD-ROM number sequence and stored in an 
appropriate storage cabinet or container. 

15-5 The local command shall assign the appropriate department to ensure assigned PEMAs are 
operated and maintained in a secure environment and meet Department of Defense (DoD) Information 
Assurance (IA) and information system security requirements.  

16-1 INCORPORATION OF UPDATES TO NAVAIR TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS (See WP 012 00) 

17-1 CHANGE ENTRY CERTIFICATION RECORD  

17-2 The CECR is used as a record by the CTPL to ensure updates to manuals have been issued to

by the CTPL librarian is not required on CTPL copies unless dictated by local policy. 

17-5 If discrepancies are identified (such as missing pages, poor quality printing, etc.), the update copies 
will not be issued to the dispersed libraries.  Additional guidance and assistance shall be requested from 
the QA division or appropriate FRC Department. 

17-6 The CTPL librarian shall train the dispersed librarian(s) in the use of the CECR and the proper 
methods of making the various types of changes to publications media held (WP 013 00). 

18-1 ISSUING AND TRACKING OF CHANGE ENTRY CERTIFICATION RECORDS 

18-2 The CTPL librarian shall maintain CECR tracking in the ELMS program containing the following for 
all changes and new documents issued; CECR issue date, CECR due date, and CECR incorporation 
date.  The ELMS program assists the CTPL Librarian in tracking CECRs by providing the following 
reports; “CECRs Issued” and “CECRs Overdue”. 

18-3 Time limits for CECR incorporation are as follows: 

a. Due to the critical nature of the update, IRACs and Rapid Action Changes (RACs) shall be 
incorporated by the work center within two (2) working days of receipt from the CTPL. 

b. Routine changes, revisions and notices shall be incorporated by the work center within five (5) 
working days of receipt from the CTPL librarian.

be received via Defense Messaging System (DMS), automatic distribution from NATEC, from the weekly 
TD tracker messages or as LEDs from the ISSC, cancelled LEDs from the program Integrated Product 
Teams (IPTs) or LEDs from external sources. 

19-4 Entry into the ELMS program is recommended however a process must be in place to track and 
control TDs, i.e. a workflow management system, if ELMS is not used to track TDs. 

19-5 Route a copy of the TD to the appropriate FRC section in according with local procedures for review 
of the TD for applicability to assigned equipment.  This may necessitate use of other work centers within 
the activity, i.e. supply, Hazardous Material (HAZMAT), etc. 

19-6 Once the applicability of the TD has been determined, the CTPL will distribute applicable copies to 
work centers identified by the local procedures for the purpose of requisitioning required material or 
compliance. 

NOTE 

A copy of the technical directives and changes related to Aviation Life Support 
Systems (ALSS) will be maintained in the ALSS work center.  Refer to WP 012 00 for 
annotating TDs to applicable paper manuals and CDs. 

19-7 A master file copy of the TD will be filed in the CTPL either in paper or electronic format. Distribution 
information will be recorded as to location of issued TD copies in the ELMS program or locally managed 
system. 

a. Positive control must be maintained by the CTPL as often TDs will be issued as Amendments, 
Revisions, etc. 

b. When TD copies are returned, the CTPL librarian will dispose of them in accordance with local 
procedures established for disposal of unclassified TMs. 

NOTE 

FRC work centers may hold copies of TDs considered to be ongoing or until all 
applicable aircraft or components have been completed.  The NATEC ELMS Program 
record for return copies shall be wiped from the database if the TD had been entered. 

19-8 Upon receipt or download by the CTPL librarian, the Weekly Summary for Issued Technical 
Directives message should be processed and retained for reference in accordance with WP 013 00. 

20-1 REPRODUCTION PAPER COPIES OF UNCLASSIFIED PUBLICATIONS 

20-2 Source of material for reproduction is an authorized CTPL copy of the publication.  A digital manual 
downloaded from the NATEC website or received from NATEC on a CD-ROM would be considered an 
authorized copy.  Requirement for reproduction is to replace missing or damaged portions of an 
authorized copy of a manual or a requirement for an additional copy.  Publications annotated with 
“Missing Pages or Changes” during an audit of a work center may be restored from the digital data 
available from NATEC. 

20-3 All reproduced copies will be managed in the same manner as the original by entering them into the 
ELMS program and affixing appropriate library stamps.  For partial publication copies, the copy held by 
the dispersed library must, as a minimum, be comprised of: the Title Page, all referenced material, all of

CTPL.  It’s a collective term for all of the records and files that represent the work carried out by the CTPL 
librarian.  Some of the records and files will be stored on the computer as digital files, some will be hard 
copy paper, others will be completed audits, still others correspondence files or training reports.  All 
documentation can be optionally stored as digital media. 

23-3 The CTPL librarian will maintain the following minimum files (records): 

a. If the Depot level activity elects to order complete ADRL CD sets, the ADRL CD set must be 
maintained by the activity and ordered once a year at a minimum.  The ADRL CD is ordered through CD 
On-Line Ordering (see WP 009 00) on the NATEC website Table of Contents (TOC). 

NOTE 

Maintaining ADRL CDs at the depot level is optional. 

b. For non-ELMS users, maintain the most recent e-mail from NATEC acknowledging processing of 
ADRL and an annotated copy of the returned ADRL file and annotated copy of the Audit Summary.  This 
is not applicable to TMAPS ELMS users. 

NOTE 

At a minimum, make a copy of CTPL's ADRL Report from TMAPS ELMS database 
annually (see WP 010 00). 

c. All correspondence on automatic distribution requirements for the past year.  TPLIS will be 
maintained in the correspondence area of the CTPL Transaction File.  Also, email traffic between the 
activity and NATEC Distribution may be retained.  These files may be held either in paper or electronic 
format or may be referenced to business systems where data is maintained (i.e. Outlook, Command 
training or information websites). 

d. CTPL audits will be retained for one year.  Dispersed library audit results shall be retained by the 
CTPL, in work center order, for four consecutive audits (one year).  They shall be reviewed for repeat 
discrepancies.  These files will help identify trends.

1-2 Conducting verifications and audits of the Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL) is a 
responsibility assigned to the Quality Assurance (QA) Division of Naval aviation units.  This work package 
(WP) does not pertain to Fleet Readiness Center (FRC) Depot CTPL.  However, WP 014 01 contains 
FRC Depot verification/audit procedures.  Verifications as defined in this WP shall consist of procedures 
performed by the CTPL personnel to confirm that all technical data (distributed by the Naval Air Technical 
Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) automatic distribution system) have been received by the 
CTPL.  Audits as defined in this WP shall consist of procedures to ensure that all technical data 
maintained in the CTPL are up-to-date. 

1-3 Figure 1 lists research/verification reference documents and their frequency of issue, and describes 
the primary purpose of each listed reference.  Items identified as “RESEARCH” documents enable the 
CTPL librarian to identify the availability of NAVAIR manuals media and Technical Directives (TDs) on an 
as-needed basis.  Items identified, as “VERIFICATION” documents shall be used to verify and annotate 
that the applicable and required NAVAIR manuals media and TDs have been received by the CTPL.  
Refer to WP 014 01 for FRC-Depot verification/audit procedure. 

2-1 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 

2-2 As each of the following VERIFICATION documents is received, the CTPL librarian will review the

1-1 PURPOSE 

1-2 Conducting verifications and audits of the Central Technical Publications Library (CTPL) librarian is a 
responsibility assigned to the Quality Assurance (QA) Division of Naval aviation units or to the 
responsible Department at the Fleet Readiness Centers (FRCs).  Verifications as defined in this work 
package (WP) shall consist of procedures performed by the CTPL personnel to confirm that all technical 
data (distributed by the Naval Air Technical Data and Engineering Service Center (NATEC) automatic 
distribution system or other authoritative activities) have been received by the CTPL.  Audits as defined in 
this WP shall consist of procedures to ensure that all technical data maintained in the FRCs are up-to-
date. 

1-3 Figure 1 lists research/verification reference documents and their frequency of issue, and describes 
the primary purpose of each listed reference.  Items identified as “RESEARCH” documents enable the 
CTPL librarian to identify the availability of NAVAIR manuals media and technical directives (TDs) on an 
as-needed basis. Items identified, as “VERIFICATION” documents shall be used to verify and annotate 
that the applicable and required NAVAIR manuals media and TDs used in the FRC are up-to-date. 

2-1 VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 

2-2 As each of the following VERIFICATION documents is received, the CTPL librarian will review the 
applicable sections. 

2-3 WEEKLY SUMMARY FOR ISSUED TECHNICAL DIRECTIVES.  Figure 2 is a weekly message 
report released by NATEC to TYCOMs/TYPE WING/Marine Air Wing (MAW) and applicable Address 
Indicator Groups (AIGs) listing TDs released during the previous week.  When FRC users fail to receive 
message TDs, the appropriate TYCOM should be notified. 

2-4 Copies of TD summaries shall be maintained on file by each activity for a period of six (6) months. 
The file of TD summaries may be in either paper or digital format.  Interim TDs are used to dispense 
urgent action information and are released in naval message format to a pre-selected distribution or AIG. 
However, formal TDs may be in the distribution cycle and as yet not received. 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 014 01

2-5 TDs identified as being applicable but not received shall be procured or downloaded from NATEC by 
the CTPL librarian and reviewed by cognizant personnel per the FRCs local routing procedures.  The 
Weekly Summary for Issued Technical Directives message is also available on the NATEC website at 
https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/.  

2-6 WEEKLY INTERIM RAPID ACTION CHANGE AND TECHNICAL MANUAL TRACKER.  Figure 3 is 
issued weekly and is available on the NATEC website (https://mynatec.navair.navy.mil/).  Copies shall be 
maintained on file by each activity for a period of six (6) months.  The file may be maintained in either 
paper or digital format.  Upon receipt, the tracker will be processed by the CTPL librarian and/or Subject 
Matter Expert (SME) to verify that all applicable Interim Rapid Action Changes (IRACs) and technical 
manuals (TMs) have been received.  TMs and Type B IRACs that have not been received may be in the 
distribution cycle and may be downloaded from NATEC for expedited processing.  For TMs, see the 
statement on the tracker for requisitioning requirements (WP 012 00).

1-1 TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS DEFICIENCY REPORT PROGRAM  

1-2 The Technical Publications Deficiency Report (TPDR) Program is one of several deficiency reporting 
programs under Naval Aviation Maintenance Discrepancy Reporting Program (NAMDRP), which 
established policy, responsibilities, and requirements for reporting substandard workmanship, improper 
procedures and deficiencies in material and publications.  The TPDR provides simplified procedure to 
submit technical publication safety hazards and routine deficiencies to the Fleet Support Team (FST) with 
engineering responsibility for the equipment covered by the deficient publication. 

1-3 Technical publication deficiencies are reported in accordance with NAMDRP using a system of 
prioritization, from technical publication safety hazards (Category 1 or CAT 1), to routine deficiencies 
(Category 2 through 4 or CAT 2 through 4).  Deficiencies discovered in NAVAIR technical directives (TDs) 
(see WP 013 00) shall be reported using the same methods as technical manuals (TMs).  For further 
information not covered in this work package, refer to COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2. 

2-1 GOALS OF THE TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS DEFICIENCY REPORT PROGRAM 

2-2 It is NAVAIR's goal to provide the fleet timely and accurate resolution of publication deficiencies and 
to provide publications incorporating the latest equipment capabilities available, in support of safe and 
effective maintenance of fielded aircraft and sub-systems.  To do this it is the responsibility of program 
FSTs, working with their respective TPDR Disposition Authorities (TDAs), to acknowledge, evaluate, 
engineer corrective actions and incorporate resolutions to TPDRs as rapidly and effectively as resources 
and priorities will allow. 

2-3 Fleet TPDR submitters play an important part in the effective solution of TPDRs by ensuring proper 
categorization of TPDRs, using CATEGORY 1, 2, 3 or 4 to accurately report deficiencies.  Application of 
the appropriate TPDR categories will help facilitate priority resolution of critical deficiencies, improving 
Technical Publication quality and resulting in an improved equipment readiness posture.   

3-1 DEFINITION OF A TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS DEFICIENCY REPORT 

3-2 For the purpose of this work package, a “Technical Publications Deficiency” is defined as a TM or TD 
lacking some form of quality, faculty, or characteristic necessary for accuracy and completeness.  With 
the implementation of Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS), the term “deficiency” was expanded to 
include acquisition data providing enhanced capabilities that are to be incorporated into existing TMs to 
further enable fleet maintenance or operations.  A listing of the more common deficiencies include: 

● Incomplete information 
● Technical inaccuracy 
● Erroneous information 
● Incorrect artwork 



NAVAIR 00-25-100 015 00 
30 December 2014 

2 

● Missing details 
● Incorrect/lacking part numbers 
● Format errors affecting maintenance 
● Warnings/Cautions not identified 
● Incorrect operating procedures 
● Incomplete troubleshooting 
● Incorrect or non-working electronic links 
● Inaccuracies of any other kind 

3-3 A “resolution” is defined as a solution to the technical publication issue reported by the TPDR, and is 
documented and issued as a Technical Publication update action, (i.e., Revision, Change, Rapid Action 
Change (RAC), Interim Rapid Action Change (IRAC) for TMs, and Amendment/Revision for TDs). 

3-4 This work package (WP) will familiarize users of NAVAIR manuals with how to report deficiencies in 
TMs through the JDRS and the use of the NATEC website in providing historical record of TPDRs 
submitted prior to July 2010.  Specific details on submitting Deficiency Reports (DR) via JDRS can be 
located in handbooks found under the Help section of the JDRS website (https://jdrs.mil).  

4-1 TYPES OF DEFICIENCY REPORTING PROGRAMS 

4-2 There are two types of manuals used to support Naval Aviation.  They are Technical Publications 
Deficiency Report for maintenance manuals and Change Recommendation for Naval Air Training and 
Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) manuals.  Each has a separate and distinct process for 
reporting deficiencies.  

 
NOTE 

 
Refer to COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 and OPNAV M-8000.16 for a complete 
description of types of TMs, and detailed instructions on the use and transmittal of 
TPDRs.  

5-1 DEFICIENCY REPORTING FOR NAVAL AIR TRAINING AND OPERATING PROCEDURES 
STANDARDIZATION MANUALS 

5-2 NATOPS publications include flight manuals, NATOPS checklists, Passenger Information Cards 
(PICs), and Ditching and Bailout Placards.  Aircraft TMs include tactical manuals, Tactical Pocket Guides, 
and Tactical Information Airborne Information Documents. 

5-3 Deficiencies are reported under the NATOPS and Aircraft Tactical Manual Programs via the 
Airworthiness Issue Resolution System (AIRS) website (https://airworthiness.navair.navy.mil).  In the 
event web access is not available recommended changes can be submitted on NATOPS/Tactical Change 
Recommendation OPNAV Form 3710/6 or by other acceptable means as specified in OPNAVINST 
3710.7.  

5-4 In addition, NATOPS Interim Changes (ICs) are tracked on the Naval Air Technical Data and 
Engineering Service Center (NATEC) website in the same manner IRACs are tracked for Maintenance 
Information Manuals (MIMs).  ICs are listed under the Technical Manual Management Section, vice the 
Source Data Module section in TMAPS. 

5-5  NATOPS deficiency reports are not submitted to NATEC and are not available in TMAPS.  Routine 
deficiencies are forwarded to the NATOPS or Aircraft Tactical Model Manager unit responsible for 
maintaining the publication.  Urgent deficiencies are forwarded to the TYCOM in the originator’s chain of 
command. 

5-6  Detailed information on the NATOPS/Tactical Manual Deficiency Reporting Program is contained in 
OPNAVINST 3710.7.

6-1 DEFICIENCY REPORTING FOR NAVAIR INSTRUMENT CALIBRATION PROCEDURE 
PROGRAM PUBLICATIONS 

6-2 Deficiencies against NAVAIR 17-20, 17-50, and 17-35 series manuals (NAVAIR Instrument 
Calibration Procedure (ICP) Program) are to be submitted on Calibration Problem Report (CPR) Card(s) 
using the process outlined in WP 006 00.  They are not to be submitted to NATEC.  Any other information 
pertaining to NAVAIR ICP Program manuals shall be directed to Corona Division (MS21), Naval Surface 
Warfare Center.  For further information, refer to METPRO CDs.  

7-1 ALTERNATE SUBMISSION METHODS FOR INTERACTIVE ELECTRONIC TECHNICAL 
MANUAL TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS DEFICIENCY REPORT  

7-2 Activities using IETMs the platforms specified below will submit TPDRs via alternate methods, as 
follows:  

The E-2D program will submit IETM TPDRs through the NAVAIR Standard IETM Viewer (NSIV) interface 
to the JDRS Offline Reporting Module (ORM).  The JDRS workflow tool will be used to process these 
TPDRs and status will be available through JDRS. 

NOTE 
The JDRS ORM works with the NSIV to collect and submit TPDRs electronically to 
JDRS.  Other IETM collection tools may also be modified to use ORM for collecting 
and submission of TPDRs.  Program inquiries may be directed to the JDRS Program 
Clearinghouse via the JDRS website at https://jdrs.mil for more details. 

8-1 TRACKING STATUS OF TECHNICAL PUBLICATIONS DEFICIENCY REPORT  

8-2 As previously stated, JDRS was implemented 12 July 2010 for most NAVAIR programs.  With this 
implementation, linkages were established between JDRS and NATEC’s TMAPS application allowing 
JDRS to pass status of new TPDRs to TMAPS.  This allows TMAPS to continue to be used as a 
management tool for fleet and technical publication managers to monitor and track both legacy and new 
TPDRs in a single system.  

8-3 JDRS reporting functions are being refined and will mature over time to provide enhanced tracking 
functionality for fleet and management TM users.  Information on use of JDRS TPDR tracking functions 
will be available on the JDRS website, at https://jdrs.mil.  Notification will be sent to all JDRS users when 
the TPDR Tracking Guide is posted on the website under the “Help” documents.  

9-1 TECHNICAL MANUAL APPLICATION SYSTEM WEBSITE 

9-2 From the TMAPS website, tracking of TPDRs is as follows:
