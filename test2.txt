CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

1-1. OVERVIEW. Prevention and repair of corrosion
damage to aircraft and avionic systems continues to be
an ever increasing cost and safety burden for military
aircraft. Equipment is routinely exposed to changes in
temperature and pressure, varying humidity levels,
dust, dirt, ultraviolet light, aircraft fluids, and environments
that promote corrosion. Increasing environmental and
safety restrictions, which limit traditional corrosion control
materials, are also a significant factor in the safe and
economic operation of aircraft and avionics.

1-1.1. The Cleaning and Corrosion Control manual
was established jointly by the Navy, Air Force, and Army
as a combined effort to consolidate and coordinate
corrosion control best practices for aircraft and avionics.

1-1.2. This volumized set of corrosion manuals
combines and replaces the former Aircraft Weapons
Systems Cleaning and Corrosion Control (NAVAIR 01-
1A-509/TM 1-1500-344-23) and Avionics Cleaning and
Corrosion Prevention/Control (NAVAIR 16-1-540/TO
1-1-689/TM 1-1500-343-23) manuals.

1-2. PURPOSE. The purpose of this manual is to
provide information on materials and procedures to

prevent, control, and repair corrosion damage to aircraft
and avionics on land or at sea.

1-3. SCOPE. The material in this manual contains
basic corrosion prevention and corrective maintenance
information to be used at Organizational, Intermediate,
and Depot levels.

1-4. ARRANGEMENT OF MANUAL.

1-4.1. OVERVIEW OF ALL VOLUMES. The NAVAIR
01-1A-509/TM 1-1500-343-23/TO 1-1-689 series of

CHAPTER 2
PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

2-1. OVERVIEW. Investigations during the past ten
years have identified corrosion as a major factor in
electronics failure in the field. As much as 30% to 40%
of military avionic failures are due to the corrosion
process. This is despite steady improvements in reliability
of avionic systems fielded to date and outlines the need
for an effective preventive maintenance program.

2-2. CORROSION PREVENTION PHILOSOPHY.
Corrosion and environmental conditions are natural
phenomena that adversely affect equipment in field
service. Although never totally eliminated, the problems
these factors cause can be minimized so that they are
less severe and better controlled. This can be achieved
by understanding equipment failure mechanisms and
development/utilization of corrosion control technology.

2-2.1. As a general rule, maintenance personnel should
assume corrosion is ongoing, regardless of visible
physical evidence. The aim of corrosion prevention is to
enable systems to perform satisfactorily for a specified
time period. In other words, maintenance efforts should
allow equipment to approach its maximum lifetime.

2-2.2. The general workflow diagram, in Figure 2-1,
defines procedures followed to implement a corrosion
preventive maintenance program. This process is
designed to indicate the sequence of events needed to
implement and maintain an effective corrosion
prevention and control program.

2-3. PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE. The two most
important factors in preventing corrosion, and the only
ones which can be controlled by field personnel, are the
removal of the electrolyte and the application of protective
coatings. Since the extent of corrosion depends on the
length of time electrolytes are in contact with metals,
aircraft corrosion can be minimized by frequent washing.
If noncorrosive cleaners are used, the more frequently
a surface is cleaned in a corrosive environment the less
the possibility of corrosive attack. In addition, by
maintaining chemical treatments and paint finishes in
good condition, corrosion can be minimized. The
degradation of non-metallic materials can be minimized
by avoiding the use of unauthorized maintenance
chemicals and procedures. In addition, when repair or
replacement of non-metallic materials is required, only
approved materials shall be used. Dedication to proper
preventive maintenance practices maximizes equipment
reliability.

2-4. AIRCRAFT PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
PROGRAM.

2-4.1. The prevention and control of corrosion on aircraft
and related equipment is a command responsibility.
Each command must place special emphasis on the
importance of the corrosion control program and lend its
full support to ensure that corrosion prevention and
control receives sufficient priority to be accomplished
along with other required maintenance.

2-4.2. Aluminum and magnesium alloys found in
aviation equipment will normally begin to corrode if salt
deposits, other corrosive soils, or electrolytes are allowed
to remain. In order to prevent corrosion, a constant
cycle of cleaning, inspection, operational preservation,
and lubrication must be followed. Prompt detection and
removal of corrosion will limit the extent of damage to
aircraft components. An effective preventive
maintenance program requires cleaning, lubrication
and preservation, as well as corrosion removal, paint
removal, surface treatment, sealing, and painting. A
disciplined preventive maintenance program includes:

a. Regularly scheduled aircraft washing as specified
by parent service organization directives;

b. Using clean water with low chloride content for
aircraft washing and rinsing (chloride content should be
less than 400 parts per million, approximately the same
limit as that for potable water);

c. Regularly scheduled cleaning or wipe down of all
exposed unpainted surfaces, such as landing gear
struts and actuating rods of hydraulic cylinders as
specified by parent service organization directives, with
a compatible fluid or lubricant;

d. Keeping low-point drains open;

e. Inspection, removal, and reapplication of corrosion
preventative compounds (CPCs) on a scheduled basis;

f. Earliest detection and repair of damaged
protective coatings; and

g. Using padded panel racks to store panels/parts
for aircraft and equipment during maintenance and
using protective measures to prevent abrasions/
scratches resulting from placement of parts, tools, or
tool boxes on wings, fuselage or other aircraft surfaces.

2-5. AVIONICS PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE
PROGRAM.

2-5.1. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. Successful
avionic cleaning and corrosion prevention/control efforts
depend on a coordinated, comprehensive preventive
maintenance program. Everyone involved in
maintenance, repair, and operation of avionic systems
must be concerned with corrosion, cleaning, inspection,
prevention, and treatment. Specifically, avionic corrosion
prevention/control is everyone’s responsibility. Each
command must place special emphasis on the corrosion

control program and lend their full support. This ensures
the program receives sufficient priority to be
accomplished along with other required maintenance.
The goal of a preventive maintenance program is to halt
corrosion before significant decline in equipment
performance occurs. As such, it is important to recognize
the difference between prevention of corrosion and
repair of damage caused by corrosion. A preventive
maintenance program at the Organizational/Unit and
Intermediate Maintenance Activities should:

a. Reduce the maintenance time spent repairing
corrosion damage.

b. Improve avionic system reliability, durability, and
service life.

c. Make the military avionics community aware of
the extent of the problem.

d. Report any deficiencies with materials and
processes associated with corrosion control.

2-5.2. APPLICABLE GUIDELINES. All activities
responsible for the maintenance of military aircraft and
avionic systems shall establish a corrosion prevention/
control program. The type of program depends on the
conditions or environments to which the aircraft/avionic
systems are exposed. Those aircraft and avionic systems
exposed to salt-air and tropical environments require
the most stringent corrosion prevention and control
programs.

2-5.3. MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS. Experience has
shown that all activities have a corrosion problem. This
is regardless of whether the equipment is an installed
avionic system, ground support equipment, or missile
system. Accordingly, corrosion control efforts by all
hands is mandatory. This must be a day-to-day
requirement to prevent corrosion before it starts.
Figure 2-2 depicts the basic maintenance functions.

2-6. CORROSION CONTROL PROGRAM. All
activities responsible for aircraft maintenance shall
establish corrosion control programs as required by the
parent service organization. This program shall be
structured as required by OPNAVINST 4790.2 (Navy),
TO 00-20-1 (Air Force), or AR 750-59 (Army) and
ensure that personnel receive hazardous material/waste
handlers training. The type of program depends upon
the environment to which the aircraft may be exposed.
At sea, where conditions are normally the most severe,
aircraft are exposed to salt spray, ship stack gases, and

aircraft engine exhausts. Land-based aircraft may be
exposed to industrial gases, salts, rain, mud, and, near
salt water, mists containing sea salts. A comprehensive
corrosion control program shall consist of either a
Corrosion Control Work Center or a Corrosion Control
Team with personnel trained in the prevention, early
detection, reporting, and repair of corrosion damage.
Such a program requires a dedicated effort by all
maintenance personnel to prevent corrosion before it
starts. These efforts will improve the operational
readiness of equipment and minimize costly repairs.

2-6.1. TRAINING. Personnel performing maintenance
on aircraft shall be trained in basic corrosion control
skills as established by the parent service organization.
Personnel shall be fully aware of the reasons for the
corrosion control program. Without such training and
understanding, further damage or additional problems
may result.

2-6.2. TRAINING AND QUALIFICATION REQUIRE-
MENTS. Personnel responsible for corrosion control
maintenance and treatment shall receive the following
training.

a. Supervisors and corrosion control personnel shall
attend basic corrosion control courses established by
the parent service organization.

b. Cleaning and repair personnel shall be trained in
inspection, identification, cleaning, treatment,
preservation, lubrication, hazardous material handling/
hazardous waste disposal, and proper documentation
reporting.

c. Supervisors shall ensure maximum use of in-
service and on-the-job-training.

2-6.3. MAINTENANCE. An effective corrosion control
program shall include thorough cleaning, inspection,
preservation, and lubrication, at specified intervals, in
accordance with Volumes II and III of this manual.
Check for corrosion damage and integrity of protective
finishes during all scheduled and unscheduled
maintenance. Early detection and repair of corrosion
will limit further damage. When corrosion is discovered,
treat corrosion as prescribed in Volumes II and III as
soon as possible and use only approved materials,
equipment, and techniques. Only affected areas shall
be repaired. All maintenance personnel shall report
corrosion promptly, in accordance with directives
established by the parent service organization.

2-7. CORROSION-RELATED FAILURE DATA
FEEDBACK.

2-7.1. Since corrosion prevention and control for aircraft
and avionics is a continuing concern, it is vitally important
that corrosion problems are properly reported. Problems
can be corrected and improvements made to prevent
reoccurrence in future equipment design. Identification
of the specific causes and extent of corrosion problems
is essential. Improved equipment performance and
maintenance assistance (personnel, equipment,
materials, and procedures) are dependent on this data.

CHAPTER 3
CORROSION THEORY

3-1. OVERVIEW.

3-1.1. Maintenance of military aircraft and avionic
equipment requires knowledge of why metals corrode
and materials degrade. The theory lies in the definition
and description of mechanisms that cause equipment
to fail in field service. Corrosion is the chemical or
electrochemical deterioration of a material. This
deterioration is complex in nature because of the various
types of corrosion, the frequent simultaneous presence
of several types of corrosion, and the design
characteristics and maintenance/environmental factors
that make aircraft and avionic systems susceptible to
corrosion.

3-1.2. Corrosion can cause complete failure of
equipment or undesirable changes in electrical
characteristics. It is a process that is active on a 24 hour
basis. Equipment does not necessarily have to be
installed, operated, or resident in a particularly harsh
environment. Some form of corrosion will take place
even in near ideal environments. All personnel should
recognize that corrosion is the natural continuing process
of materials returning to their normal state. Inadequate
corrosion prevention and control will ultimately affect
equipment life cycles, downtime, and overall system
reliability.

3-2. PURPOSE. The purpose of this chapter is to
provide maintenance personnel with the background
knowledge necessary to understand the causes of
corrosion.

3-3. SCOPE. This chapter is an introduction to corrosion
theory: the causes of corrosion and the factors which
influence its development. The theory of corrosion and
the factors influencing corrosion of aircraft metals are
described. The types of corrosion and how to recognize
them are discussed.

3-4. DEFINITION OF CORROSION. Corrosion is the
electrochemical deterioration of a material or its
properties due to its chemical reaction with the
surrounding environment. This reaction occurs because
of the tendency of metals to return to their naturally
occurring state, usually oxide or sulfide ores. For
example, iron in the presence of moisture and air will
return to its natural state, iron oxide or rust. Aluminum
and magnesium form corrosion products that are white
oxides or hydroxides. When a water solution containing
soluble salts is present, corrosion of many alloys can

occur easily at ambient temperatures. This type of
corrosion can be effectively treated by maintenance
personnel as discussed in this manual. Corrosion can
also occur in the absence of water but only at high
temperatures, such as those found in gas turbine
engines. However, the most common type of corrosion
(and the one that can be most effectively treated by
maintenance personnel) is electrochemical corrosion.

3-5. CHEMICAL DEFINITIONS.

3-5.1. ATOM. The smallest unit of an element, made
up of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by a
system of negatively charged electrons. There are over
100 elements, including metals (such as aluminum,
magnesium, gold, platinum, iron, nickel, titanium,
cadmium, chromium, copper, silver, lead, beryllium,
zinc), and non-metals (such as carbon, boron, sulfur,
chlorine, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and helium).

3-5.2. ELECTRON. A negatively charged subatomic
particle. An electric current occurs when electrons are
forced to move through metal conductors. Electrons
flow through liquid solutions only in the presence of
ions.

3-5.3. ION. An atom or group of atoms or molecules
which has acquired a net electric charge by gaining
(negative ion) or losing (positive ion) electrons. When
ions are forced to move through liquid solutions, an
electric current can occur. Ions cannot move through
metal conductors.

3-5.4. ELECTROLYTE. A liquid (usually water) solution
containing ions. Sea water is an electrolyte: an aqueous
(water-based) solution whose major components are
sodium and chloride ions. Electrochemistry is the branch
of science concerned with chemical reactions at surfaces
in contact with electrolytes.

3-6. THEORY OF CORROSION. All metals will corrode
to some extent in a natural environment. When a metal
corrodes, the atoms lose electrons and become positively
charged. In solution, the positively charged metal ions
can combine with negatively charged ions to form
corrosion products, such as metallic chlorides, oxides,
hydroxides, and sulfides.

3-6.1. Four conditions (illustrated in Figure 3-1) must
exist before metal corrosion can occur.



3-2

NAVAIR 01-1A-509-1
TM 1-1500-344-23-1
TO 1-1-689-1

01 March 2005

a. A metal which has a tendency to corrode must
be present (the corroding metal is called the anode);

b. A dissimilar conductive material (the cathode),
which has less tendency to corrode than the anode,
must be present (a dissimilar metal may be a different
metal, a protected part of the same metal, or conductive
plastic);

c. A conductive liquid (electrolyte) must connect the
anode and cathode (so that ions can carry electric
current between them); and

d. Electrical contact between the anode and cathode
(usually in the form of metal-to-metal contact) must
exist so that electrons can move between the anode
and the cathode.

3-6.2. The elimination of any one of the four conditions
will slow or stop corrosion. For example, a paint film on
a metal surface will prevent the electrolyte from
connecting the anode and cathode, thereby stopping
the electric current (see Figure 3-2). A change in the
electrolyte can also affect the rate of corrosion. Two
connected dissimilar metal parts placed in distilled
water corrode very slowly due to a lack of ions in solution
to conduct the electric current; in sea water the corrosion
reaction is accelerated by a factor of 1000 or more (see
Figure 3-3).

3-7. DEVELOPMENT OF CORROSION. All corrosive
attack begins on the surface of the metal. If allowed to
progress, corrosion can penetrate into the metal. If

corrosion begins on an inside surface of a component
(for example, the inner wall of a metal tube), it may go
undetected until perforation occurs.

3-7.1. When corrosion products form, they often
precipitate onto the corroding surface as a powdery
deposit. This film of corrosion products may reduce the
rate of corrosion, if the film acts like a barrier to
electrolytes. Some metals (such as stainless steel and
titanium), under the right conditions, produce corrosion
products that are so tightly bound to the corroding metal
that they form an invisible oxide film (called a passive
film) which prevents further corrosion. However, when
the film of corrosion products is loose and porous (such
as those of aluminum and magnesium), an electrolyte
can easily penetrate and continue the corrosion process,
producing more extensive damage than surface
appearance would indicate.

3-7.2. Paint coatings can mask the initial stages of
corrosion. Since corrosion products occupy more volume
than the original metal, the paint surfaces may become
blistered, flaked, chipped, or appear lumpy.

3-8. FACTORS INFLUENCING CORROSION. Factors
which influence metal corrosion and the rate of corrosion
are outlined below.

3-8.1. TYPE OF MATERIAL. The best time to prevent
corrosion is at the design stage. Proper material selection
is critical for the protection of equipment against harmful
environmental effects. Most pure metals are not suitable
for aircraft construction and are used only in combination
with other metals, and sometimes non-metals, to form
alloys. The metals most commonly used in aircraft
construction are aluminum, steel, titanium, and
magnesium. Cadmium, nickel, chromium, and silver
are sometimes used as protective platings. Metals have
a wide range of corrosion resistance. The most active
metals (those which tend to lose electrons easily), such
as magnesium and aluminum, corrode easily and are
listed at the top of Figure 3-4. The most noble metals
(those which do not lose electrons easily), such as gold
and silver, do not corrode easily and are listed at the
bottom of Figure 3-4.

3-8.2. HEAT TREATMENT AND GRAIN DIRECTION.
Most alloys are made up entirely of small crystalline
regions called grains. When heat treated during
manufacturing or repair, heavy sections of metals do
not cool uniformly and, as a result, tend to vary in
chemical composition from one part of the metal to
another. This can cause corrosion if one area is more
active than another. Alloys which are fabricated by
rolling, extruding, forging, or pressing have properties
which depend highly on direction (parallel to grain
elongation vs. cross grain). Corrosion can occur on
surfaces of those regions which are less resistant and
also at grain boundaries, resulting in the formation of
pits and intergranular corrosion. For example, exposed
end grains corrode much more easily than flattened
elongated surfaces in sheet stock. This explains why
exfoliation occurs at the edge of aircraft skin sections or
next to countersunk fasteners.

3-8.3. DISSIMILAR METALS. When two dissimilar
metals make electrical contact in the presence of an
electrolyte, the rate at which corrosion occurs depends
on the difference in their activities, that is, their positions
in Figure 3-4. The greater the difference in activity, the

faster corrosion occurs. For example, magnesium
would corrode very quickly when coupled with gold in
a humid atmosphere. But aluminum would corrode
very slowly, if at all, in contact with cadmium. A
flashlight battery is an example of galvanic corrosion
put to practical use. In Figure 3-5, the zinc battery
casing steadily corrodes, supplying a steady flow of
electrons, but only when the switch is closed. When
the switch is open, there is no corrosion because
electrons are not able to leave the zinc anode.

3-8.4. ANODE AND CATHODE SURFACE AREA.
The rate of corrosion also depends on the size of the
parts in contact. If the surface area of the corroding
metal (the anode) is smaller than the surface area of
the less active metal (the cathode), corrosion will be
rapid and severe. But, when the corroding metal is
larger than the less active metal, corrosion will be slow
and superficial. For example, an aluminum fastener in
contact with a relatively inert monel structure may
corrode severely, while a monel bracket secured to a
large aluminum member would result in a relatively
superficial attack on the aluminum sheet (see
Figure 3-6).

3-8.5. PRESENCE OF ELECTROLYTES. Electrically
conducting solutions are easily formed on metallic
surfaces when condensation, salt spray, rain, or rinse
water accumulate. Dirt, salt, acidic stack gases, and
engine exhaust gases can dissolve on wet surfaces,
increasing the electrical conductivity of the electrolyte,
thereby increasing the rate of corrosion.

3-8.6. ELECTROLYTE CONCENTRATION. In the
same way that metals can corrode when exposed to
different concentrations of oxygen in an electrolyte,
corrosion will also occur if the concentration of the
electrolyte on the surface varies from one location to
another. This corrosive situation is known as a
concentration cell.

3-8.7. AVAILABILITY OF OXYGEN. When some of the
electrolyte on a metal surface is partially confined (such
as between faying surfaces or in a deep crevice), metal
in this confined area corrodes more rapidly than other
metal surfaces of the same part outside this area. This
type of corrosion is called an oxygen concentration cell
or differential aeration cell. Corrosion occurs more
rapidly than would be expected because the reduced
oxygen content of the confined electrolyte causes the
adjacent metal to become anodic to the metal surfaces
exposed to the air.

3-8.8. TEMPERATURE. Higher temperature
environments tend to produce more rapid corrosion due
to accelerated chemical reactions and, in humid
environments, higher concentration of water vapor in
the air. In addition, nightly drops in temperature can
cause greater amounts of condensation, leading to
increased corrosion rates.

3-8.9. BIOLOGICAL ORGANISMS. Bacterias, molds,
fungi, and other living organisms (some microscopic)
can grow on damp surfaces. Once they are well
established, the area tends to remain damp, increasing
the possibility of corrosion. Their presence can cause
the areas they occupy to have different oxygen and
electrolyte concentrations. In addition, acidic wastes
are secreted, which cause corrosion.

3-8.10. MECHANICAL STRESS. Many alloys used in
aircraft construction are sensitive to a form of corrosion
known as stress corrosion cracking. Manufacturing
processes such as machining, forming, welding, or heat
treatment can leave residual mechanical stresses in
aircraft parts. The addition of in-service stresses to
residual stresses can cause corrosion to proceed more
rapidly than would be expected in normal service.

3-8.11. LENGTH OF EXPOSURE. As time passes,
metals naturally tend to corrode. In some cases, the
corrosion process occurs at the same rate, no matter
how long the metal has been exposed to the environment.
In other cases, corrosion can decrease with time, due to
the barrier formed by corrosion products, or increase
with time if a barrier to corrosion is being broken down.

3-9. TYPES OF CORROSION. Corrosion is
catalogued and typed in many ways. Occasionally,
different names are used for the same type of corrosion.
The common types of corrosion are described below.

3-9.1. UNIFORM SURFACE CORROSION. Uniform
surface corrosion is probably the most common type of
corrosion. It results from a direct chemical attack on a
metal surface that proceeds uniformly over the entire
exposed surface (see Figure 3-7). The metal gradually
becomes thinner and eventually fails. On a polished
surface, this type of corrosion is first seen as a general
dulling or etching of the surface and, if the attack is
allowed to continue, the surface becomes rough and
possibly frosted in appearance. An example is the
etching of metals by acids. The discoloration or general
dulling of metal created by exposure to elevated
temperatures is not considered to be uniform surface
corrosion. Coating/sealing the exposed surface will
protect it from this type of attack. Also, corrosive elements
may be removed through air movement and drain holes.

3-9.2. GALVANIC CORROSION. Galvanic corrosion
occurs when different metals are in contact with each
other and an electrolyte, such as sea water. It is usually
recognizable by the presence of a buildup of corrosion
deposits at the joint between the metals. For example,
aluminum skin panels and stainless steel doublers,
riveted together in an aircraft wing, form a galvanic
couple if moisture and contamination are present.
Figure 3-8 shows galvanic corrosion of magnesium
adjacent to steel fasteners. The potential for galvanic
corrosion is greatest when the two metals are well
separated from each other in the galvanic series (see
Figure 3-4) and are in electrical contact.

3-9.3. PITTING CORROSION. Pitting is a form of
extremely localized attack that results in holes in the
metal (see Figure 3-9). Pits can be isolated, or so
close together that they look like a rough surface. Pits
are often difficult to detect because of their small size
and because they may be covered with corrosion
products. Pitting is usually first noticeable as a white or
gray powdery deposit, similar to dust, which blotches
the surface. When the deposit is cleaned away, tiny
pits or holes can be seen in the surface. Most pits
develop and grow downward (in the direction of gravity)
from a horizontal surface. Pitting failures are commonly
caused by electrolytes containing chloride or chlorine-

containing ions (such as seawater). Stainless steels
are most susceptible to pitting damage, although
aluminum, magnesium, and copper are often attacked
(see Figure 3-10).

3-9.4. INTERGRANULAR CORROSION.
Intergranular corrosion is an attack on the grain
boundaries of the metal. A highly magnified cross
section of any commercial alloy (see Figures 3-11 and
3-12) shows the granular structure of the metal. It
consists of quantities of individual grains, each having
a clearly defined boundary, which chemically differs
from the metal within the grain. Frequently the grain
boundaries are anodic (tend to corrode more easily) to
the metal within the grain. When an electrolyte is
present, rapid selective corrosion of the grain
boundaries occurs. High strength aluminum alloys,
which depend on precipitated phases of alloying
elements for strength, are particularly susceptible to
intergranular attack. Figure 3-13 shows how
intergranular corrosion progresses in 7075-T6
aluminum alloy adjacent to steel fasteners. In this
example, the grain boundaries are anodic to both the
metal grain and the steel fastener.

3-9.5. EXFOLIATION CORROSION. Exfoliation (see
Figures 3-14 and 3-15) is an advanced form of
intergranular corrosion where the surface grains of a
metal are lifted up by the force of expanding corrosion
products occurring at the grain boundaries. The lifting
up or swelling is visible evidence of exfoliation corrosion.
Exfoliation occurs on extruded, rolled, wrought, and
forged high strength aluminum and magnesium parts.
This type of corrosion most often occurs on extruded
sections of metal and is found primarily in aluminum
sheet around steel fasteners. Its prevention involves
separating the aluminum and steel by a barrier, such as
zinc-chromate primer or sealant.

3-9.6. CREVICE CORROSION. Crevice corrosion is
one of the most familiar types of corrosion. Field
experience shows that this type of corrosion may occur
in any crevice where a stagnant solution has pooled.
Crevices are usually located at gasket surfaces, lap
joints, and under bolt or rivet heads. Crevice corrosion
occurs because the environment of the local area is
very different from the larger environment. As a result,
the metal surfaces, even though they may be the same
metal, have different activities, and corrosion occurs
inside the crevice. This kind of corrosion can also occur
when a surface is covered by a foreign material. Methods
to minimize crevice corrosion include closing the crevice

by welding, sealant, or soldering, and use of
nonabsorbent gaskets (such as Teflon).

3-9.6.1. Oxygen Differential Cells. Electrolyte in
contact with metal surfaces will normally contain
dissolved oxygen. An oxygen cell can develop at any
point where the oxygen in the air is not allowed to
diffuse into the solution, thereby creating a difference
in oxygen concentration between two points. Typical
locations of oxygen differential cells are under either
metallic or non-metallic deposits (dirt) on the metal
surface and under faying surfaces such as riveted lap
joints. Oxygen cells can also develop under gaskets,

wood, rubber, plastic tape, and other materials in
contact with the metal surface. Corrosion will occur at
the area of low oxygen concentration (anode) as
illustrated Figure 3-16, View A. Alloys such as stainless
steel, which owe their corrosion resistance to surface
passivity, are particularly susceptible to this type of
crevice corrosion.

3-9.6.2. Active/Passive Cells. Metals which depend
on a tightly adhering passive film, such as the oxide
film on corrosion resistant steel, are prone to rapid
corrosive attack by active/passive cells. The corrosive
action usually starts with a deposit of dirt or salt which

creates an oxygen differential cell. The passive film is
then broken in the area of the salt deposit and the more
active metal beneath the passive film will be exposed
to corrosive attack. This small anodic area will then
corrode rapidly due to the much larger area of the
surrounding cathode (passive film). The result is rapid
pitting of the surface, as illustrated in Figure 3-16,
View B.

3-9.7. FILIFORM CORROSION. Filiform corrosion is
a form of crevice corrosion which occurs on metal
surfaces having a thin (~4 mils) organic protective
coating. It is recognized by its characteristic wormlike
trace of corrosion products beneath the coating (see
Figure 3-17). Filiform corrosion is unusual because it
only affects surface appearance, but does not weaken

or destroy the base metal. Filiform corrosion occurs
when the relative humidity of the air is between 65 and
90%, and the air temperature is between 70° and 100°F.
It starts at breaks in the coating system, such as
scratches and cracks around fasteners and seams, and
proceeds underneath the coating, due to the diffusion
of water vapor and oxygen from the air through the
coating (see Figure 3-18). Filiform corrosion can attack

steel, magnesium, and aluminum surfaces and may
lead to more serious corrosion in some locations.
Filiform corrosion can be prevented by storing
equipment and aircraft in an environment with a relative
humidity below 65%, by using coating systems having
a low rate of diffusion for oxygen and water vapors, by
maintaining coatings in good condition (prompt touchup
around fasteners), and applying corrosion preventive
compounds (CPCs) when the coating is damaged.

3-9.8. EROSION CORROSION. Erosion corrosion is
the increase in the rate of attack on a metal due to the
action of a corrosive fluid against the metal surface.
Generally the movement is rapid, and wear or abrasion
occurs with the corrosion. Erosion corrosion is
characterized by grooves, gullies, waves, rounded holes
and/or valleys in the metal surface. Metals that are soft
(copper, lead) or metals that depend upon the
development of a protective surface film (aluminum,
stainless steel) are susceptible to erosion corrosion
damage. Equipment exposed to moving fluids (e.g.
heat exchanger tubing, pumps, propellers, impellers)
are also susceptible.

3-9.9. STRESS CORROSION. Also called stress
corrosion cracking (SCC). Stress corrosion
(Figure 3-19) is the intergranular or transgranular
cracking of a metal caused by the combined effects of
constant tensile stress (internal or applied) and corrosion.
Internal or residual stresses may be produced by welding,
cold working, forming, and heat treatment operations
during the manufacture of a part. Stresses remain
concealed in the part unless stress relief operations
are used. Other hidden stresses are induced in parts
when press or shrink fits are used and when slightly
mismatched parts are clamped together with rivets and
bolts. All these stresses add to those caused by applying
normal loads to parts in operation. Stress corrosion is
normally localized and appears in the form of cracks.
During SCC, the metal is unattacked over most of its
surface, while fine cracks progress through the interior
of the part. Cracking is generally perpendicular to the
applied stress. Metals have threshold stresses below
which stress corrosion cracking will not occur. This
threshold stress varies from metal to metal, is different
for different tempers of the same metal, and is different
for each of the three directions in which stress can be
applied. In aircraft, high strength steel parts (e. g.
landing gear) and high strength aluminum parts are
particularly susceptible to stress corrosion.

3-9.9.1. Associated Hazards. Stress corrosion cracking
is an extremely dangerous type of failure because it can

occur at stress levels far below the rated strength of a
metal, starting from what appears to be a very minor
corrosion pit. This type of failure can be catastrophic
and occur without warning. Parts can completely sever
in a split second or they can crack slowly. The rate of
cracking and the stress limit is very unpredictable in
operating service. For example, 7075-T6 aluminum
alloy can fail by stress corrosion cracking when subjected
to a stress which is only 10% of its rated strength.

3-9.9.2. Causes. Specific environments have been
identified which cause stress corrosion cracking of
certain alloys. Salt solutions, sea water, and moist salt
laden air may cause stress corrosion cracking of heat
treatable aluminum alloys, stainless steels, and some
titanium alloys. Magnesium alloys may stress corrode
in moist air. Stress corrosion can be prevented by
placing an insulating barrier between the metal and the
corrosive environment, or by applying protective coatings
and/or water displacing corrosion preventive
compounds. Stress relief operations during fabrication

Corrosion Fatigue)

of parts will help, because it lowers the internal stress
level of the part. Shot peening a metal increases
resistance to stress corrosion cracking by creating
compressive stresses on the surface, which must be
overcome by an applied tensile stress before the
surface sees any tension load. Changing the alloy (for
example, replacing an aluminum 7075-T6 part with
one made from 7075-T73 or –T76 alloy) can greatly
increase resistance to SCC.

3-9.10. CORROSION FATIGUE. Corrosion fatigue
(see Figure 3-19) is the cracking of metals caused by
the combined effects of cyclic stress and corrosion. No
metal is immune to reduction in its resistance to cyclic
stress if the metal is in a corrosive environment. Corrosion
damages the metal by pitting, followed by crack formation
in the pitted area due to cyclic stress. The crack is
propagated predominantly in the fatigue mode, in which
the rate of cracking is controlled by the stress
concentration in the main cross section, the physical
properties of the metal, and the presence of corrosion
products on the crack face. Fracture of a metal part due
to corrosion fatigue occurs when the remaining cross-
sectional area is unable to carry the applied loads. Like
stress corrosion, corrosion fatigue is normally localized
and appears in the form of cracks. The metal is generally
unattacked over most of its surface, while the crack
progresses through the part. Cracking is generally
perpendicular to the applied stress. Protection of all
parts subject to cyclic stress is particularly important,
even in environments that are only mildly corrosive.
Preventive measures include reducing the stress on the
part, using corrosion inhibitors, and applying a metallic
coating (e.g. chromium, cadmium, or ion vapor deposition
(IVD) aluminum) to the part.

3-9.11. FRETTING CORROSION. Fretting corrosion
occurs at contact areas between materials under load
subject to repeated vibration. The relative motion needed
to produce fretting is extremely small (sometimes as
little as 10-8 cm). The corrosion products increase the
wear of the surface, and the wear exposes more bare
metal surface to be corroded. The overall effect is
greater than the single effects of corrosion and wear
added together. Fretting has the general appearance of
galling, in which chunks of metal are torn from the
surface with corrosion at the torn areas or ragged pits
(see Figure 3-20). Although fretting corrosion can take
place on any metal, aluminum, stainless steel, and
titanium alloys are most susceptible. These metals
depend on an oxide surface film to inhibit further
corrosion. With rapid movement under pressure at the
interface, the oxides are removed and rapid oxidation

occurs. Moisture does not appear to increase the
corrosion; in fact, it tends to slow down the reaction.
Fretting corrosion is normally encountered in heavily
loaded static joints which are subject to vibration, such
as landing gear component attachment areas having
lug holes with slight press fits, slip fit bushings with
very close tolerance bolts passing through the bushings,
wing root access panels or wing-to-body fairings, and
engine blade roots. Practical means of reducing fretting
corrosion include reducing the amount of relative motion
at the surface, adding a lubricant at the interface to
reduce friction and seal out oxygen, increasing the
surface hardness of the part, and increasing the overall
hardness of one or both contacting metals.

3-9.12. HOT CORROSION. Also called high
temperature oxidation. Corrosion in the absence of
water can occur at high temperatures, such as those
found in turbine engine combustors, turbine sections,
and afterburners. When hot enough, metals can react
directly with the surrounding gases, producing oxide
scale (see Figures 3-21 and 3-22). Contaminants,
such as chlorides and sulfates, can accelerate the hot
corrosion reaction by reducing the melting point of the
metallic oxide and promoting its vaporization. High
temperature ceramic coatings can reduce this type of
corrosion but are usually applied only by the
manufacturer due to the highly specialized equipment
required for application.

3-10. METALS AFFECTED BY CORROSION. No
metal has perfect environmental integrity and is totally
resistant to corrosion. As a result, all metals will corrode
sooner or later. The characteristics of corrosion on
aircraft metals are summarized in Table 3-1. The

following paragraphs discuss the corrosion
characteristics of commonly used aircraft metals.

3-10.1. ALUMINUM. Aluminum and aluminum alloys
are the most widely used materials for aircraft
construction. In addition to its uses in aircraft structure,
aluminum and aluminum alloys are widely used in
equipment housings, chassis, mounting racks,
supports, frames and electrical connector shells.
Aluminum is highly anodic, as evidenced by its position
in the galvanic series table. It is anodic to most other
metals, and, when in contact with them, galvanic
corrosion of the aluminum will occur. Aluminum alloys
are subject to pitting, intergranular corrosion, and
stress corrosion cracking. In some cases, the corrosion
products of a metal in contact with aluminum are
corrosive to aluminum. However, the formation of a
tightly adhering oxide film offers increased resistance
under mild corrosive conditions. The corrosion product
of aluminum is a white to gray powdery material
(aluminum oxide or hydroxide) which can be removed
by mechanical polishing or brushing with abrasives
(Figure 3-23). Therefore, it is necessary to clean and
protect aluminum and its alloys against corrosion.
Since pure aluminum is more corrosion resistant than
most alloys, aluminum sheet stock is often covered
with a thin layer of nearly pure aluminum called cladding
or alclad. However, in a marine environment, all
aluminum surfaces require protection. Cladding is
easily removed by harsh treatment with abrasives and
tooling, exposing the more corrodible alloy surface.
Chemical conversion coating, paints, and corrosion
preventive compounds are the main methods of
protection.

3-10.2. ANODIZED ALUMINUM. Some aluminum
parts are protected with an electrochemically applied
oxide coating called anodize. Aluminum oxide film on
aluminum is a naturally occurring protective film, and
anodizing merely increases the thickness of the oxide
film. When this coating is damaged in service, it can be
only partially restored by chemical surface treatment.
Unnecessary destruction (e.g. nicks and scratches) of
the anodized surface must be avoided.

3-10.3. MAGNESIUM. Magnesium alloys are the
lightest structural metals used for aircraft and missile
airframes. Magnesium alloys are used extensively
throughout avionic systems as antennas, structures,
chassis, supports, and frames (radar). Magnesium is
also used extensively for transmission and gearbox
housings. These alloys are highly susceptible to
corrosion when the metal surface is exposed to the
environment without a protective finish. The corrosion
products are white powdery snow-like mounds (see
Figure 3-24). The deposits have a tendency to raise
slightly and the corrosion spreads rapidly. When the
white puffy areas are discovered, it requires prompt
treatment or the corrosion will penetrate entirely through
the structure. The natural oxide-carbonate film formed
on magnesium alloys does not provide sufficient
corrosion protection even in the mildest environment.
The rate of corrosion of a magnesium alloy increases
when the alloy is immersed in water or periodically
subjected to moisture. Corrosion may also be
accelerated by dissimilar metal couples and when
conductive contaminants are dissolved in the water.
Corrosion of magnesium alloys can be greatly
diminished by the use of the proper protective finish,
such as magnesium conversion coating and paint.
Some magnesium parts in current aircraft have been
originally protected by anodizing processes. Coatings

of this type are thicker than those applied by immersion
or brush on conversion coating. Anodized finishes cannot
be restored in the field. Care should be taken to minimize
removal of these coatings.

3-10.4. STEEL. Ferrous (iron) alloys are used to
manufacture many aircraft components and massive
structures and assemblies in aircraft ground support
equipment, such as missile gantries, silo crib structures,
frames and bodies of trailers and vans, and lesser
structural parts such as brackets, racks, and panels.
Iron and steel are also used as component leads,
magnetic shields, transformer cores, brackets, racks,
and general hardware in avionic systems. If unprotected,
ferrous alloy surfaces (with the exception of stainless
steels) are easily corroded in the presence of moisture.
Corrosion of steel is easily recognized because the
corrosion product is red rust (Figure 3-25). When
ferrous alloys corrode, a dark corrosion product usually
forms first. When moisture is present, this coating is
converted to red rust, which promotes further attack by
absorbing moisture from the air. Ferrous alloy surfaces
of structures or assemblies are normally painted, or
plated with nickel, tin, or cadmium and painted, to
prevent corrosion.

3-10.5. STAINLESS STEEL. Stainless steels, or
corrosion resistant steels (as they are more properly
described) are alloys of iron containing large amounts
of chromium and nickel. Stainless steels are used for
gears, bearings, and high strength bolts, and for
mountings, racks, brackets, and hardware in avionic
systems. The main reason for the existence of stainless
steels is their resistance to corrosion. Stainless steels
are much more resistant to common rusting, chemical
action, and high temperature oxidation than ordinary
steels, due to the formation of an invisible oxide film, or

passive layer, on the surface of these alloys. Corrosion
and heat resistance are the major factors in selecting
stainless steels for a specific application. However, it
should be well understood that stainless steels are not
the cure-all for all corrosion problems, due to service
conditions which can destroy the oxide film on their
surfaces. Stainless steels are susceptible to crevice
corrosion and stress corrosion cracking in moist, salt
laden environments. Exposure to saltwater can cause
pitting. The corrosion product of stainless steel is a
roughened surface with a red, brown, or black stain.
Corrosion treatment of stainless steel should be limited
to cleaning. Stainless steels can cause galvanic
corrosion of almost any other metal with which they are
in contact if proper techniques of sealing and protective
coating are not used. Stainless steels may be magnetic
or non-magnetic. The magnetic steels are identified by
numbers in the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI)
400 Series (e.g. 410, 430). These steels are not as
corrosion resistant as the non-magnetic steels, which
are identified by numbers in the AISI 300 Series (e.g.
304, 316).

3-10.6. TITANIUM. Titanium and titanium alloys find
numerous uses in aircraft, engines, and missiles at
temperatures up to 1000°F (540°C). Above 1000°F,
titanium readily absorbs gases from the surrounding air
and becomes very brittle. Under certain conditions,
chlorides and some chlorinated solvents may induce
stress corrosion cracking of certain titanium alloys.
Titanium and its alloys are highly corrosion resistant. An
oxide film forms on their surfaces almost immediately
upon contact with air, which is extremely adherent to
the surfaces and provides a protective barrier. This is
identical to the way aluminum forms a protective oxide
film on its surface. Even at temperatures approaching
1000°F, titanium retains its strength and corrosion
resistance. When titanium is heated, oxides having

TM 1-1500-344-23-1

TO 1-1-689-1

different colors form on the surface (see Figure 3-26).
A blue oxide coating will form at 700° to 800°F (370° to
425°C), a purple oxide at 800° to 950°F (425° to
510°C), and a gray or black oxide at 1000°F (540°C) or
higher. These are protective discolorations and should
not be removed. Since titanium is the less active member
(cathodic) of most dissimilar metal couples, it can greatly
accelerate corrosion of a dissimilar metal coupled to it.
Electrical insulation between titanium and other metals
is necessary to prevent galvanic corrosion of the other
metal. Titanium in contact with a corroding metal can
absorb hydrogen and become brittle. Frequent
inspection of such areas is required to insure that
insulation failure has not allowed corrosion to begin.

3-10.7. CADMIUM. Cadmium is used as a coating to
protect steel hardware, such as bolts, washers, and
screws, and as plating on electrical connectors. It is
used as a plating on high strength steel parts (e.g.
landing gear) to improve resistance to corrosion fatigue.
Cadmium may also used to provide a compatible surface
when a part is in contact with other materials. Cadmium,
when coupled with steel, is anodic and protects the steel
by galvanic action. Corrosion on cadmium is evident
by white to brown to black mottling of the surface.
When cadmium plate shows mottling and cracks in the
coating, the plating is still performing its protective
function as an anodic material (see Figure 3-27). The
cadmium plate on iron or steel is still protecting the
base metal until signs of rust begin to appear. Even
then, any mechanical removal of corrosion products

should be limited to metal surfaces from which the
cadmium has been depleted. Care should be taken not
to remove undamaged cadmium plate adjacent to the
corroded area.

3-10.8. CHROMIUM. Chromium is used as a protective
plating. Chromium plating is also used to provide a
smooth, wear-resistant surface and to reclaim worn
parts. When corrosion resistance in a marine
environment is required, a nickel under-coat is used.
The degree of protection is dependent upon plating
thickness. Chromium forms a continuous oxide coating
that can be polished to a high luster and still protect not
only itself but any underlying metal. Chromium coatings
contain cracks, and corrosion may originate at the base
metal below these separations. Figure 3-28 shows the
results of a failed chromium plate.

3-10.9. NICKEL. Nickel is important as a plating metal,
an additive to stainless steel, and a base for nickel
alloys. Pure nickel is used as an electroless coating and
is subject to pitting corrosion. Flaking of the nickel
coating can also occur when an underlying metal
corrodes. When added to stainless steel alloys, the
stress corrosion resistance increases with nickel
contents above 10%. Nickel based alloys are used in
high temperature areas (engines, afterburners), but
they are subject to hot corrosion attack and embrittlement
when sulfur containing gases are present.

3-10.10. COPPER AND COPPER ALLOYS. Copper
and copper-based alloys (brass and bronze) are
considered corrosion resistant, with corrosion usually
limited to staining and tarnish. Copper and copper-
based alloys are generally used in avionic systems as
contacts, springs, leads, connectors, printed circuit
board (PCB) conductors, and wires. Generally, changes
in surface conditions are not dangerous and should
ordinarily have no effect on the part. Copper corrosion
is evidenced by the accumulation of blue or blue-green

corrosion products on the corroded part (see
Figure 3-29). Sometimes copper or copper alloy
surfaces tarnish to a dull gray-green color (patina) and
the surface will remain relatively smooth. This
discoloration is the result of the formation of a fine-
grained, airtight copper oxide crust. This crust offers
good protection for the underlying metal in ordinary
situations. However, exposure of copper and copper
alloys to moisture or salt spray causes the formation of
blue-green salts, indicating active surface corrosion,
which should be removed. When coupled with most
metals used in aircraft construction, copper is the less
active metal and greatly accelerates corrosion of iron,
steel, aluminum, and magnesium. Examples are usually
found in electrical components and in areas where
copper bonding strips or wires are fastened to an
aluminum chassis or structural components. Protective
paint coatings are seldom required because of the
inherent resistance of the metal. However, paint finishes
may be applied for decorative purposes or if the normal
tarnish or green patina on the copper is objectionable.

3-10.11. SILVER. Silver is used as a plating material
over copper in waveguides, miniature and
microminiature circuits, wires, contacts, high frequency
cavities, tank circuits, and RF shielding. Silver does not
corrode in the ordinary sense, although it will tarnish in
the presence of sulfur. The tarnish appears as a brown
to black film. The tarnish is silver sulfide and may or
may not be detrimental to circuit electrical
characteristics, depending on the application. When
silver is plated over copper there can be an accelerated
corrosion of the copper. This occurs through galvanic
action at pinholes or breaks in the silver plating. One
example of this is the deterioration of silver plated

copper wire. This problem is compounded because
the wire insulation prohibits detection of breaks in the
silver plating until damage is extensive. This “red
plague” is readily identifiable by the presence of a
brown-red powder deposit on the exposed copper.
Silver plating over nickel plate does not exhibit the red
plague phenomenon.

3-10.12. GOLD. Traditionally considered the best
coating for corrosion resistance and solderability, gold
is used on printed circuits, semiconductors, leads, and
contacts. Gold is usually applied in a thin layer over
nickel, silver, or copper. Gold is a noble metal (pure
metal in nature) and does not normally corrode; however,
a slight deposit will appear as a darkening of reflecting
surfaces. Tarnish removal is critical on gold components
because of the very thin coatings used. Gold plated over
silver or copper in thin layers accelerates corrosion over
the less noble metals (silver or copper). This occurs at
pores or pinholes in the gold. This corrosion is readily
identified as darkening of the silver or blue-green deposits
on the copper. "Purple plague" is a brittle gold-aluminum
compound formed when bonding gold to aluminum.
The growth of such a compound can cause failure in
microelectronic interconnection bonds.

3-10.13. TIN. The use of tin in solder is a well-known
application. However, tin plating is also common on
avionic RF shields, filters, crystal covers, and automatic
switching devices. Tin has the best combination of
solderability and corrosion resistance of any metallic
coating. However, tin has a tendency to grow “whiskers”
on tin plated wire and other plated applications.

3-11. DEGRADATION OF NON-METALS. Non-
metallic materials (plastics, elastomers, paints and
adhesives) are not subject to electrochemical corrosion,
since ions are not easily formed from non-metallic
materials and since the electrical conductivity of non-
metals is extremely low. The degradation of non-metals
depends on the chemical makeup of the material and
the nature of the environment. In general, aircraft non-
metallic materials are selected for their performance
properties (flexibility, transparency, strength, electrical
resistance). Also, resistance to heat, impact, abrasion,
ultraviolet radiation, moisture, ozone and other
detrimental gases, as well as operational fluids such
as hydraulic fluid, lubricants, cleaners, and deicing
fluids, must be considered. However, the use of
unauthorized maintenance chemicals and procedures
can accelerate degradation. In almost all cases, the
deterioration of a nonmetallic material permits moisture
intrusion. This creates physical swelling, distortion,

mechanical failure through cracking, and altering of
electrical characteristics. The most common nonmetals
used in aircraft systems and their modes of deterioration
are listed in Table 3-2. Examples of nonmetallic
deterioration are discussed in the following paragraphs.

3-11.1. GRAPHITE/CARBON FIBER COMPOSITES.
Graphite or carbon fiber composites are materials which
consist of reinforcing fibers in a matrix made of organic
resin, usually epoxy. They are an important class of
aviation materials because of their high strength-to-
weight ratios and high stiffness. Composite materials
are found in aircraft structure, connectors, enclosures,
EMI seals and gaskets. Since carbon is the least active
metal in the galvanic series, it will accelerate the
corrosion of any aircraft metal to which it is coupled.
Insulation between graphite or carbon epoxy
composites and other metals is necessary to prevent
dissimilar metal attack on the attached part.

3-11.2. ENCAPSULANTS AND CONFORMAL
COATINGS. Encapsulants and conformal coatings are
used to envelop an avionic component, module or

assembly. These materials are considered nearly as
effective as hermetic sealing. Typical materials used for
this purpose are epoxy, polyurethane, silicone rubber,
acrylic, and varnish. Because these materials are
organic, they are susceptible to moisture, varying
temperature, and fungus. Moisture accumulates when
incorrect repair procedures cause imperfections and
bubbles, or when the coating is applied too thick. High
temperatures may cause corrosive vapor to outgas
from encapsulants and conformal coatings. This
problem is of special concern if a circuit component
burns on a conformal coated circuit board. These
gaseous vapors can penetrate under circuit board
coatings and cause major corrosion damage.

3-11.3. POTTING COMPOUNDS. Potting compounds
are used to encase a part or component, such as in an
electrical connector. Generally, potting compounds
are considered to be a good seal against moisture
when correctly applied. Problems occur when potting
compounds are cured too quickly, not mixed properly,
or the surface is not cleaned completely. Aging of
certain potting compounds can cause the potting
compound to harden and become brittle, or soften and

revert. Usually, the process of potting involves the use
of a mold to form the potting compound. These molds
are made of plastic and may become the source of
moisture intrusion. All molds should be removed after
the potting compound has cured (refer to Volume III).

3-11.4. LAMINATE CIRCUIT BOARDS. Laminate
circuit boards typically use encapsulants or conformal
coatings as sealers. In some cases, the laminate is not
sealed along the edge or at the contact tabs. This
allows the laminate board to absorb moisture and
delaminate. Overcleaning with abrasive materials may
damage the resin surface of the laminate board. High
temperatures caused by the burning of a circuit
component may char the laminate surface and increase
moisture intrusion.

3-11.5. RUBBERS AND ELASTOMERS. Rubbers and
elastomers are used for insulation, seals, gaskets,
caps, tubing, films, and coatings. Natural rubber, silicone
rubber, and polyurethane are normally susceptible to
attack by fungi, microbes, ozone and ultraviolet light.
Polyurethane and silicone rubber are to some extent
permeable to moisture.

3-11.6. TAPES. Some pressure sensitive tapes are
effective moisture barriers. Problems arise with cloth or
paper-based tapes. These materials absorb moisture
and support fungal attack. This is particularly true when
wicking action takes place on the cloth or paper material.
Some tapes deteriorate and outgas, emitting an acid
that is corrosive to metals.

3-11.7. OILS. The lubricants used in some electronic
equipment are capable of minimizing moisture intrusion
and corrosion attack. However, at high temperatures
and pressures, oils can chemically react with impurities
to produce acids. Oil can hold a limited amount of water.
Excess water will separate from the oil if the holding
capacity is reached at a given temperature.

3-11.8. MATERIAL INCOMPATIBILITY OF
NONMETALLICS. The complexity of modern aircraft
and avionics makes it difficult to predict what problems
may result from reactions between materials.
Incompatibility of materials can cause deterioration of
the nonmetallic substances. This may result in the
release of chemicals or gases that react with other
components. In some cases, cleaning solutions, high
temperature, or lubricants will cause a reaction in
nonmetallic substances. Common examples of
nonmetallic materials incompatibility are as follows:

3-11.8.1. Solvents. Some encapsulants, conformal
coatings, and acrylic plastics soften or dissolve when
they come in contact with cleaning solvents.

3-11.8.2. Heat. The heating of conformal coatings for
removal or repair may outgas corrosive vapors onto
metal components. Shrinkage elastomers (heat-
shrinkable tubing) can damage adjacent circuitry when
heat guns are applied to shrink the tubing. Certain oils
(such as silicones) and greases “creep” as temperature
increases. This causes contamination of adjacent
surfaces, degradation of organic coatings, and attraction
of particulates.

3-11.8.3. Acid Creation. Some commercial conformal
coating strippers contain acids that attack PCB laminates
and discolor or corrode copper. Certain room
temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone sealants contain
acetic acid that is highly corrosive to metal components
(a list of authorized RTV silicone sealants is provided in
Volume III). Degradation of polyvinylchloride (PVC)
gives off acid fumes that are corrosive to most materials
used in avionics. Some solid film lubricants contain
uninhibited molybdenum disulfide which, with moisture
and heat, may form sulfuric acid.

3-11.8.4. Form Change. Some potting compounds
revert to liquid form under certain conditions. This
reversion causes a maintenance problem and reduces
the moisture protection in electrical connectors.

3-11.8.5. Oil and Lubricants. Application of conformal
coatings, adhesives, and paint finishes is difficult when
silicone oil film is present on base material. Some solid
film lubricants containing graphite are corrosive. Graphite
and moisture will promote galvanic corrosion in many
metals. Some lubricants will attack neoprene, plastics,
rubber, organic materials, and most paints.

3-11.8.6. Plastics. Plastics can be damaged by solar
heating and cosmic radiation. The damage is a visible
darkening, discoloration, or color fading of the plastic.
Lower pressures and vacuum can cause outgassing
and loss of plasticizers/ flexibilizers. This can cause a
change in structural properties such as loss of strength.
The damage is appears as embrittlement and crazing
of the surface, as well as loss of electrical properties.

3-12. EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENT ON
CORROSION. Corrosion of aviation equipment occurs
in both natural and man-made environments. In
addition, the aircraft operational and maintenance
environment contributes to unique corrosion conditions.



3-19

NAVAIR 01-1A-509-1
TM 1-1500-344-23-1

TO 1-1-689-1

01 March 2005

Natural conditions in the environment which affect the
corrosion process are moisture, temperature, salt
atmospheres, ozone, sand, dust, and solar radiation.
Corrosion may also be promoted by biological sources,
including animals, insects, and microorganisms. Man-
made conditions, which also affect the corrosion
process, include industrial pollution, manufacturing
operations, packaging, storage conditions, and
shipment. By understanding these conditions,
maintenance personnel will be better able to prevent
aircraft damage.

3-13. NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS.

3-13.1. MOISTURE. Moisture is present in air as a gas
(water vapor) or as finely divided droplets of liquid (mist
or fog). It often contains contaminants such as chlorides,
sulfates, and nitrates, which increase its corrosive effects.
Moisture enters all areas of an aircraft that air can enter.
Enclosed areas which are not sealed allow air to enter
and leave as the pressure between the interior and
exterior changes. These pressure differences occur
when the aircraft changes altitude, when atmospheric
pressure changes, and when the temperature of air
inside an enclosed area changes.

3-13.1.1. Condensed Moisture. Moisture will condense
out of air when the air becomes too cool to hold all of the
moisture in it. The dew found on aircraft after a cool night
is the result of condensation. Condensed moisture
usually evaporates as the surrounding air warms, but
leaves contaminants, including salts, behind. This can
result in the build-up of soils and salt contamination.
Condensed moisture and its contaminants can also be
trapped in close fitting wettable joints, such as faying
surfaces. Some gasket and packing materials will absorb
several times their weight in water and, when heated,
can transmit this retained moisture into the sealed area.
Moisture can accumulate in such areas through
successive cycles of warming and cooling. In addition,
moisture can be drawn along poor bond lines by capillary
action (wicking). Temperature and humidity conditions
can vary widely in separate sections of aircraft depending
on the success of environmental sealing, condensation,
and location near heat-generating equipment.

3-13.1.2. Effect of Moisture. Electrolyte formation
results from condensation of moisture. All non-metals
absorb some moisture, which may cause changes in
dimensional stability, dielectric strengths, ignition
voltages, and volume insulation resistances. In general,
organic matrix composites are adversely affected by
moisture and may suffer a loss of strength and stiffness

from exposure. Hermetic sealing (liquid and vapor
proof at normal temperatures and pressures) is
recommended for moisture-critical items such as
capacitors and quartz crystals.

3-13.2. SALT ATMOSPHERES. Salt forms a strong
electrolyte when dissolved in water, which causes rapid
corrosion of unprotected metal surfaces. The primary
source of the world’s salt is the ocean, which is 3.5% to
3.9% salt. Normal sea winds can carry from 10 to 100
pounds of seasalt per cubic mile of air. Since dissolved
salts are strong electrolytes, it is easy to understand
why corrosion is such a severe problem in shipboard
and coastal environments.

3-13.3. OZONE. Ozone is a particularly active form of
oxygen which is formed naturally during thunderstorms,
by arcing in electrical devices, and by photochemical
reactions in smog. When ozone is absorbed by
electrolyte solutions in contact with metals, it increases
the rate of corrosion. It also oxidizes many nonmetallic
materials, being particularly harmful to natural and
certain types of synthetic rubber. Rubber seals stored
near welding equipment have experienced complete
degradation.

3-13.4. SOLAR RADIATION. The two ranges of solar
radiation most damaging to materials are ultraviolet (the
range that causes sunburn) and infrared (the range that
makes sunlight feel warm). On earth, maximum solar
radiation occurs in the tropics and equatorial regions,
but considerable damage occurs in the temperate zones
as a result of solar heating, photochemical effects, and
combinations of these two phenomena. Non-metals,
especially organic and synthetic materials, are strongly
affected by sunlight. Both natural and synthetic rubber
deteriorate rapidly when exposed to sunlight. After
extended exposure, plastics darken, paints lose their
protective characteristics, polymers undergo marked
decreases in strength and toughness, and colors fade,
removing essential color coding. Most electronic
equipment is housed in enclosed structures and is
protected from solar radiation. Extra care must be taken
in the selection and surface treatment of parts, such as
cables and harnesses, that are exposed to exterior
environments.

3-13.5. TEMPERATURE. High temperature either
improves or impairs the performance of avionic
equipment, depending on conditions. Corrosion and
other harmful processes (outgassing, decomposition)
increase as temperature rises. However, moderate
increases in temperature may prevent condensation.



3-20

NAVAIR 01-1A-509-1
TM 1-1500-344-23-1
TO 1-1-689-1

01 March 2005

Most fungus growth is inhibited by temperatures above
104°F (40°C). Low temperatures pose no real threat of
corrosion except that as temperature drops relative
humidity rises. The greatest problem in extremely low
temperatures, as in polar regions, is the shrinkage of
seals and gaskets. This results in leakage and
embrittlement of organic materials. If temperatures
vary sufficiently, moisture may condense to form liquid
water in the equipment. Similarly, the introduction of
cooling air may cause condensation. If moisture
intrusion occurs, subsequent freezing can cause the
entrapped moisture to expand, resulting in structural
damage.

3-13.6. PRESSURE. Most military equipment is
intended for service in low pressure (high altitude)
environments. These environments create the familiar
corona, arcing, and poor cooling problems in avionic
equipment. Another problem is that of cyclic low and
high pressures. These varying pressures create leaky
seals and cause breathing. Breathing promotes
condensation and creates a corrosive environment.
Low pressure also causes outgassing (loss of volatile
components, such as plasticizers) of plastics and other
organic materials. Very low pressure causes changes
to the physical and chemical properties of some
materials.

3-13.7. SAND, DUST, AND VOLCANIC ASH. Some of
the least recognized contributors to corrosion are sand,
dust, and volcanic ash. They often contain a number of
tar products, ashes, and soot. Sand, dust and volcanic
ash are hygroscopic and, when present on internal or
external surfaces of aircraft or electronic parts, can
absorb and hold moisture. This provides an electrolyte
for corrosion and the growth of fungus. The presence of
sand, dust or volcanic ash may also affect the operation
of electrical contacts, prevent proper action of rotating
motor-drive devices, and cause malfunctions of
indicating instruments. Sand and dust are extreme
problems in the deserts, since dry, powdery sand and
dust are easily carried by wind. During sandstorms,
they can penetrate sealed equipment as well as internal
areas of airframes. In arid regions such as deserts,
small sand particles are often blown as high as 10,000
feet by the siroccos (hot, dust laden winds). Sand and
dust on surfaces can cause an abrasive action when the
surfaces are moved or vibrated. This removes the
protective oxide coatings and leaves the metal exposed.
Volcanic ash contains chlorides and sulfates, which
are extremely corrosive in the presence of moisture.
Although small amounts of sand, dust, or ash may be

unnoticed by operating personnel, they may be
sufficient to initiate or promote corrosion.

3-13.8. CLIMATE. Warm, moist air, normally found in
tropical climates, tends to accelerate corrosion. Cold,
dry air, normally found in arctic climates, tends to
reduce corrosion rates. Corrosion does not occur in
very dry conditions. For this reason, desiccants are
used in shipping containers to produce very dry local
environments. The operational climate extremes have
always been considered in aircraft design. However,
certain areas within an aircraft, such as the cockpit and
air conditioned equipment bays, may be subjected to
climatic conditions very different from external areas of
the aircraft. Relatively warm, dry air that has been
cooled by air conditioners, thus reducing its ability to
hold moisture, and ducted into interior areas of the
aircraft, can release sufficient moisture to accelerate
corrosion. It is imperative, therefore, to consider not
only the operational environment but also the
environments in which the equipment will be fabricated,
transported, reworked, or repaired.

3-13.8.1. Desert. The hot, wind-swept desert creates a
severe maintenance problem because powdery dust
can penetrate even supposedly sealed components.
High daytime temperatures, high humidities (in areas
such as the Persian Gulf), ultraviolet radiation, and fine
dust are the four most serious, destructive elements of
the desert climate. Nonmetallic materials suffer the
most damage from the hot desert climates, where air
temperatures during the day may reach 124°F (50°C).
Temperatures inside closed containers may be 100°F
(38°C) higher than external air temperatures.

3-13.8.2. Temperate Zones. The temperate or
intermediate climate zone encompasses most of the
North American and European continents. These areas
at various times of the year may approximate the
extremes of polar, desert, or tropical temperatures and
humidity. The temperate zone temperatures range from
-25° to 59°F (-32° to 15°C) in the winter and from 59° to
125°F (15° to 52°C) in summer. The relative humidity
also fluctuates between five and 100%. The most critical
areas are coastal locations: during the warm periods of
the year the relative humidity approaches 100% at
night and the air has high concentrations of salt.
Moisture from this salt-laden air can condense on
equipment during early evening and morning hours,
thereby causing serious corrosion. Because of its
relatively mild temperatures, the temperate zone is
also the most heavily populated. Consequently, the



3-21

TM 1-1500-344-23-1

TO 1-1-689-1

01 March 2005

smoke, smog, ozone, and corrosive fumes associated
with heavy industry are also present.

3-13.8.3. Tropics. The greatest challenge to the aircraft
industry is the design of equipment that is protected
from corrosion and deterioration in the heat and humidity
that prevails in the tropics. Even though they
encompass only a small portion of the earth’s land
area, the tropics demand the greatest amount of
consideration from the standpoint of corrosion treatment
and control. The tropical environment is sustained by
long periods of heavy rainfall, during which as many as
100 inches of rain may fall. Relative humidities of up to
100% at ambient air temperatures of 85°F (29°C) pose
formidable threats of corrosion. When high humidity
and temperature conditions are combined with salt-
laden air, the corrosive environment becomes extremely
severe. Extended periods of high heat and humidity
contribute to rapid corrosion of metals, cracking and
flaking of rubber and plastic materials, and deterioration
of seals. Equipment, whether stored or in use, requires
special protective containers and frequent preventive
maintenance. Many items become covered with fungi in
a matter of hours. For effective operation of electronic
equipment in the tropics, special efforts must be made.
The critical combination of high temperatures,
condensation, high relative humidity, and contaminants
such as salt and sand may cause catastrophic failure of
equipment. Intensive preventive maintenance and the
best possible protective techniques are necessary for
aircraft and their components.

3-14. BIOLOGICAL CORROSION.

3-14.1. ANIMAL AND INSECT DAMAGE. Damage to
aircraft and aircraft subsystems may be caused by
insects, birds, and various small animals, especially in
tropical environments. Equipment in storage is most
susceptible to this type of attack. Insects and small
animals may enter through vent holes or tears in
packaging and sometimes build nests. They like to feed
on various organic materials, such as polyethylene,
insulation, and wire coatings, which can result in system
or equipment failure. Another type of damage can occur
when electrical insulation, varnishes, and circuit board
coatings are eaten by insects. When bare wires or
circuit components are exposed, more areas become
available for corrosion and shorting to occur. Moisture
absorbed by nests plus excretions from animals may
cause corrosion and deterioration that goes unnoticed
until equipment is put to use and fails. Damage may also
occur when organic materials, such as upholstery, are
shredded for nests or consumed as food.

3-14.2. MICROORGANISMS. Microbial attack, as the
term is used in this manual, includes the action of
bacteria, fungi, or molds. Microorganisms are nearly
everywhere and outnumber all other types of living
organisms. Those organisms causing the greatest
corrosion problems are bacteria and fungi (see
Figure 3-30). Damage resulting from microbial growth
can be caused by: (1) the tendency of the growth to hold
moisture, which then causes corrosion; (2) digestion of
the substrate as food for the microorganism; or (3)
corrosion of the surface beneath the growth by secreted
corrosive fluids. Modern avionic equipment, because
of complexity, dense packaging, and higher sensitivity,
is more susceptible to damage from microbes than
earlier systems. Condensed moisture can provide
conditions that promote the growth of molds, bacteria,
and fungi. Once established, these growths continue
to absorb and hold moisture. Acid secretions from the
microorganisms are strong electrolytes. These
electrolytes corrode the underlying metal. Some
nonmetals provide nutrients that can accelerate growth.
The presence of bacteria and fungi can readily be
identified by damp, slimy, and bad smelling growths.
These vary in color from black, bluegreen, green, to
yellow. Table 3-3 lists some common materials and
the corresponding effect of moisture and fungi.

3-14.2.1. Bacteria. Bacteria may be either aerobic or
anaerobic. Aerobic bacteria require oxygen to live.
They can accelerate corrosion by oxidizing sulfur to
produce sulfuric acid or by oxidizing ammonia to
produce nitric acid. Bacteria living adjacent to metals
may promote corrosion by depleting the oxygen supply
or by releasing metabolic products. Anaerobic bacteria,
on the other hand, can survive only when oxygen is not

present. The metabolism of these bacteria requires
them to obtain food sources by oxidizing inorganic
compounds such as iron, sulfur, hydrogen, and carbon
monoxide. The resultant chemical reactions cause
corrosion.

3-14.2.2. Microbial Growth Requirements. Fungi make
up one class of microorganism that feeds on organic
matter. Low humidity levels will inhibit the growth of
most species of fungi and bacteria. Ideal growth
conditions for most fungi and bacteria are temperatures
between 68° and 104°F (20° and 40°C) and relative
humidities between 85 and 100%. It was formerly
believed that microbial attack could be prevented by
applying moisture-proof coatings to nutrient materials

or by drying the interiors of compartments with
desiccants. However, some moisture-proof coatings
are attacked by microorganisms, especially if the
surface on which they are used is already contaminated.
Some microorganisms can survive in spore form for
long periods while dry, and can become active when
moisture is available. When desiccants become
saturated and unable to absorb moisture in the affected
area, microorganisms can begin to grow. Dirt, dust,
and other airborne contaminants are the least
recognized contributors to microbial attack. Unnoticed,
small amounts of airborne debris may be sufficient to
promote fungal growth.

3-14.2.3. Microbial Nutrients. Since fungi, bacteria,
and other microorganisms are classified as living, it was
previously thought that only materials derived from
living organisms could provide food for microorganisms.
Thus, wool, cotton, feathers, and leather are known to
be microbial nutrients. To a large extent this rule of
thumb is still valid, but the increasing complexity of
synthetic materials makes it difficult, if not impossible, to
determine from the name alone whether a material will
support growth of microorganisms. Many otherwise
resistant synthetic materials are rendered susceptible
to microbial attack by the addition of chemicals, which
change the properties of the material. In addition,
different species of microorganisms have different
growth requirements. The service life, size, shape,
surface smoothness, cleanliness, environment, and
species of microorganism involved all determine the
degree of microbial attack on the affected item.

3-15. MAN-MADE ENVIRONMENTS.

3-15.1. INDUSTRIAL POLLUTANTS. Carbon from
internal combustion engine exhaust, nitrates from
agricultural fertilizers and industrial processes, ozone
from electrical motors and welding operations, sulfur
dioxide from engine exhaust and industrial and ship
smoke stacks, and sulfates from automobile exhaust
are significant pollutants. Corrosive solutions form when
these contaminants are absorbed by condensed
moisture. Many of the fumes and vapors emitted by
ships and from factories can greatly accelerate metal
corrosion. Industrial atmospheres may exist over large
areas, since wind may carry these corrodents many
miles from their source. The combination of these
pollutants contributes to the deterioration of non-metallic
materials and severe corrosion of metals.

3-15.2. MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND
REPAIR. During the manufacture, assembly, or repair
of aircraft and subsystem components, many factors
that might lead to corrosion may be introduced. The use
of unsuitable materials and improper material processing
can cause corrosion. Shearing or hole-punching
operations on some metal alloys, especially high-
strength aluminum, may introduce stresses that
eventually lead to corrosion. Assembly or repair of
avionic components in areas contaminated by fumes or
vapors from adjacent operations (such as welding,
paint spraying, and solvent cleaning) may result in
entrapment of fumes in the equipment and may cause
corrosion. Air conditioned avionic shops are inherently
lower in temperature than surrounding spaces. In
shops without humidity control, the air conditioning
system can create condensation. This is of particular

concern after working hours because the absence of
shop personnel (body heat) and the lack of heat
generated by operating various equipment create lower
temperatures. Thermostats should be adjusted to
prevent excessive cooling and condensation after
working hours.

3-15.3. SOLDER FLUX CORROSION. The simple task
of soldering a component in a circuit board can cause
corrosion, often due to failure to remove flux residues.
Most metals exposed to the atmosphere develop a thin
film of oxide. This film is not visible and solder alone
cannot dissolve it. During soldering operations, the
addition of flux removes the oxide film and prevents
further metal oxidation. Although most flux is burned
away during the soldering process, some residues
remain and must be removed. Residues from solder
fluxes can degrade circuitry by causing solder joints to
corrode, causing corrosive flux vapors that settle on
adjacent components, reducing insulation resistance,
changing the resistivity of the solder joint, and attracting
dirt and other contaminants that may absorb moisture.
Refer to ANSI/J-STD-001 for general solder information.
Refer to ANSI/J-STD-004, -005, -006 for solder flux
requirements for securing connections in electrical or
electronic equipment. Refer to NAVAIR 01-1A-505
(Navy), TO 1-1A- 14 (Air Force), or TM 55-1500-323-24
(Army) for additional information on solder fluxes and
soldering techniques.

3-15.4. EQUIPMENT HANDLING. Equipment removed
from aircraft for maintenance or inspection may be
exposed to various environments. Equipment that
requires handling or protection against the environment
should be preserved and packaged accordingly. In
some cases, special containers are furnished for the
purpose of protecting the equipment. Where containers
or special packaging are not furnished, steps shall be
taken to provide the protection required. For example,
a printed circuit board (PCB) that has been repaired but
not coated with conformal coating requires protection
against electrostatic discharge and contaminants. It
should be placed in an antistatic bag and transported
using a covered antistatic tote tray or fast pack from the
repair station to the test bench. Components with
conductive coatings shall be protected from abrasion,
damage, and electrostatic discharge. Corrosion that
develops as a result of improper handling or inadequate
packaging, storage, and shipment is extremely
destructive. Some of the same design characteristics
that support corrosion in equipment on board aircraft
also lead to deterioration in inadequately packaged,
stored, and shipped components. All uninstalled avionic
equipment should be preserved and stored in shock

and moisture resistant packaging with an active
desiccant. The following unacceptable conditions should
be corrected:

a. Equipment with a high replacement rate that is
kept unprotected.

b. Equipment moved on an open flat bed vehicle
between the removing/installing activity and the repair
shops that is unprotected.

c. Equipment exposed to the environment awaiting
transfer to the repair shop or depot activity that is
unprotected.

3-15.5. PACKAGING. Packaging is intended to protect
equipment or components against corrosion,
deterioration, and physical damage during transportation
and storage. Avoid the use of unsuitable materials, or
corrosion attack may occur as a result of improper
packaging materials. Proper packaging techniques are
not necessarily limited to the manufacturing or shipping
activity but concern the shop technician as well. Certain
woods, cottons, foams, and papers absorb moisture
and are susceptible to mold and fungus attack. These
materials, and shredded newspaper, excelsior, and
fiberboard, may emit acidic vapors. Corrosive vapors
are not only a product of wood but other incompletely
cured organic materials such as glues, paints, varnishes,
resins, and preservatives. Outgassing (decomposition)
of organic materials such as adhesives, gaskets,
sealants, wire insulation, sleevings, tubing, plastics,
and circuit board varnishes also may produce corrosive
organic acid vapors. When corrosive vapors are
released in a confined space or in a piece of avionic

equipment, serious corrosion attack will occur in the
presence of moisture. Instructions for proper packaging
are given in MIL-STD-2073-1.

3-15.6. STORAGE. Even traces of corrosive vapor in
packages containing aircraft parts may result in serious
corrosion. Moreover, the natural breathing of packages
may introduce moisture into the parts and equipment.
Some packing materials have been known to decompose
and emit corrosive vapors during periods of prolonged
storage. Avionic equipment should not be stored in
wooden boxes, fiberboard containers, or vented
containers, especially during air shipment. Refer to
NAVAIR 15-01-500 (Navy), TM 743-200-1 (Army), or
T.O. 1-1-17 (Air Force) for additional storage information.

3-15.7. SHIPMENT. During shipment, materials such
as plastics and lubricants are often exposed to
environments that were not considered during the design
stage. Materials shipped by air are subjected to changes
in atmospheric pressure and can lose volatile
components by outgassing. The vibration and
mechanical shocks associated with shipment by truck
can damage protective coatings or platings. Shipment
by ocean vessel may expose the equipment to corrosive
marine environments, vibrations and shock from engines
or sea conditions, and residual corrosive vapors from
previous shipments. Equipment should be properly
packaged in accordance with MIL-STD-2073-1 to
minimize damage during shipment. Packaging
damaged during shipment should be repaired as soon
as possible.

3-15.8. AIRCRAFT FLUIDS. Many fluids can be
present in various areas of an airframe. Table 3-4 lists

the types of fluid intrusion and the possible effects.
Some of these fluids are corrosive to metals, while
others are destructive to seals. The destruction of
seals may lead to fluid penetration into areas that are
considered protected. Some fluids are from external
sources, while others are present due to internal leaks
or servicing spills.

3-15.9. OPERATIONAL AND MAINTENANCE
ENVIRONMENT. All personnel should familiarize
themselves with their local environment, such as
moisture, temperature, atmospheric pressure, salt,
water, sand, and dust. The type of aircraft, aircraft
mission, and ground operations also influence the rate
of corrosion.

3-15.9.1. Type of Aircraft. Fixed-wing and rotary-wing
aircraft have some airframe flexibility, which results in
seal deterioration. This allows moisture/fluid intrusion.
Vulnerable areas include gaskets on access doors/
panels; fuselage flexure points; vents, ducts, and static
pressure sensors; equipment bay door and
electromagnetic interference (EMI) gaskets; radome
and antenna seals; and opening for steps.

3-15.9.2. Effects of Aircraft Mission. A number of field
corrosion problems are a result of the mission of the
aircraft. For example, during a search and rescue (SAR)
operation, helicopter flights are performed with the
doors and windows open for optimum visibility. This
causes water to enter the cabin, bilge areas, and lower
mounted avionic equipment. During low-level over water

flights involved in anti-submarine warfare (ASW),
moisture is introduced into aircraft via the fine ocean
spray prevalent at lower altitudes. This moisture
saturates wiring harnesses, connectors, antennas,
waveguides, and switches, and causes frequent
equipment failure. Flight operations in tropical
environments can produce conditions that support the
growth of fungus and other microorganisms.

3-15.9.3. Protection of Aircraft During Ground
Operations. Equipment can also be damaged during
maintenance periods. Many problems are encountered
while aircraft are parked. In general, the majority of
aircraft ground time is spent with the aircraft opened up
or unbuttoned. It is often necessary for canopies and
access panels to be open during certain maintenance
functions. This produces situations where moisture,
rain, or ocean spray may soak cockpit and internal
avionic components. Inspection and timely corrosion
control is essential for proper operation and full life
cycle. Maintenance operation time varies widely between
types of equipment and depends largely on reliability
and troubleshooting time. Most front-line combat aircraft
average 1 to 2 hours per day in flight operations. In
some cases, aircraft may be nonoperational for extended
periods while waiting for spare parts. This increases the
vulnerability of the entire system to corrosion. Some of
the potential problems associated with increased
maintenance operation time are as follows:

a. The avionic system(s) involved may be open
(radomes up, equipment bay doors open, canopies
raised) for extended periods.

b. Maintenance may damage seals and the locking
integrity of fasteners, scratch protective finishes, and
otherwise impart wear and tear to the aircraft.

c. Components may be moved several miles and
exposed to the environment between the removing/
installing activity and the repair shops.

GLOSSARY

A

A-SCAN - A data presentation method for ultrasonic
inspection. Data is displayed on a cathode ray tube
(CRT). Sound energy amplitude is plotted on the vertical
axis and distance (or time of flight) on the horizontal
axis.

Abrade - To prepare a surface by roughening through
sanding or mechanical means.

Accelerator - A compound that hastens a reaction,
especially one that reduces the curing or hardening
time of compounds.

Acetic Acid - A clear, colorless organic acid with a
distinctive sharp odor (e.g. vinegar). Sometimes used
as a solvent.

Acidic - Acid forming or having acid characteristics.

Active Metal - A metal ready to corrode, or being
corroded.

Additive - A substance added in small amounts to
something else for a particular purpose. For example,
substances are added to fuel and lubricants to prevent
corrosion, gum formation, varnishing, sludge formation,
or knocking.

Adhesion - The chemical and/or mechanical bonding
of a material to a surface.

Adhesion Promoter - A material applied to a surface
to chemically enhance the adhesion of a paint or
sealant to the surface.

Adhesive - Substance capable of holding materials
together by surface attachment. Adhesive is a general
term for glue, cement, or paste.

Aeration Cell - An electrolytic cell in which the driving
force results from a difference in the amount of oxygen
in solution from one point to another. Corrosion is
accelerated in areas where the oxygen concentration is
least; for example, in a stuffing box or under packing.

Aerobic - A process which occurs in the presence of
oxygen.

Air Curing - Thermosetting or curing at ordinary room
temperature without the addition of heat.

Aircraft Controlling Custodian - Navy command
responsible for specific aircraft (AIRLANT, AIRPAC,
CNAVRES, CNATRA, or NAVAIR).

Alkaline - Having a pH of more than 7.

Alloy - A combination of two or more metals.

Anaerobic - A process which occurs in the absence of
oxygen.

Anion - A negatively charged ion that migrates toward
the anode in an electrolyte. The chloride ion in sea water
is an anion.

Anode - The positively charged electrode of an
electrolytic cell at which oxidation or corrosion occurs.
It may be a small area on the surface of a metal or alloy,
such as that where a pit develops, or it may be the more
active metal in a cell composed of two dissimilar metals,
(i.e., the one with the greater tendency to go into
solution).

Anodize - Application of a protective oxide film on a
metal (such as aluminum) through an electrolytic
process. This layer provides protection from corrosion
and is a good base for paint.

Anodic Protection - Formation of a protective film on
metals by externally applied anodic current. A
potentiostat is used to maintain the potential difference
between the metal and a reference electrode. At
somewhat higher values of potential, the current drops
to a very low value, the metal becomes passive, and
corrosion is greatly reduced.

Application Time - The length of time after mixing that
sealant remains suitable for application to the substrate.

Aqueous - Relating to, like, containing, or dissolved in
water.

Assembly Time - The maximum length of time after
mixing or thawing that sealant remains suitable to
assemble parts, including final tightening of fasteners,
to assure proper sealing.

capillary action.

Carbonize - To reduce or convert into carbon, usually
by high heat or partial burning.

Cathode - The negatively charged electrode of an
electrolytic cell, where the action of the corrosion current
causes a reduction reaction. This results in the nearly
complete elimination of corrosion.

Cation - A positively charged ion of an electrolyte which
migrates toward the cathode. Metallic ions, such as iron
or copper, are cations.

Cathodic Protection - Corrosion protection achieved
by supplying electrons to the metal to be protected. The
source of the protective current may be a sacrificial
metal, such as magnesium, zinc, or aluminum, which
creates a galvanic coupling. The current may also be
supplied by a power source (rectifier, generator, or
battery) attached to an appropriate anode and the metal

to be protected. As the current passes to the metal,
corrosion is suppressed.

Catalyst - The component of a two-part curing-type
sealant that causes the polymer to react.

Caustic Embrittlement - Aluminum and its alloys are
rapidly attacked by even dilute alkali solutions. The
result of the combined action of tensile stress and
corrosion due to the alkali solution causes caustic
embrittlement.

Cavitation - The sudden formation and collapse of low
pressure bubbles in a liquid stream by means of
mechanical forces. Cavitation is often encountered
around propellers, rudders, struts, and in pumps.

Cell - In corrosion processes, a cell is a single unit of
electrolysis that is responsible for corrosion. It consists
of an anode and a cathode immersed in an electrolyte
and electrically joined together. The anode and cathode
may be two separate metals or dissimilar areas on the
same metal.

Chalking - Deterioration of an organic coating during
exposure to the environment that results in a powdery,
chalky residue on the painted surface.

Channel Seal - A seal formed by injecting a noncuring
sealant material into a groove machined in one faying
surface of the mating or overlapping structure after
assembly.

Checking - Fine cracks in a surface film due to excessive
shrinkage of the film or expansion of the surface.

Chemical Conversion Coating - A chemical treatment
of a metal surface, such as aluminum or magnesium,
which results in a protective (corrosion resistant) layer
on the metal’s surface. Types of application include
immersion, brushing, or spraying with the selected
chemical solution. Coatings covered by MIL-C-5541
are examples. The protective layer also greatly enhances
paint adhesion

Chlorides - Certain compounds of chlorine that are
extremely corrosive. Most pitting corrosion is associated
with chlorides. Many varieties are present in seawater
and contribute to making seawater corrosive.

Clean - Free from dirt or pollution.

above its melting point so that the powder particles flow
together or cure.

Primer Coat - The first coat of a protective paint system.
Originally applied to improve adherence of succeeding
coat(s), it now usually also contains a corrosion inhibitor.

R

Relative Humidity - The ratio (expressed as a percent)
of the actual moisture content of the air relative to the
maximum moisture content of the air fully saturated at
the same temperature.

Retarders - A solvent added to a paint to slow down its
evaporation rate.

Reversion - The process in which a cured material
reverts toward its precured condition, e.g. a cured
potting compound reverts to a sticky, liquid-like
consistency.

Room Temperature Vulcanizing (RTV) - A process for
treating or curing of synthetic rubber or plastic materials
which occurs at room temperature.

S

Sacrificial Anode - A metal that is anodic to the metal
being protected. It corrodes preferentially when
galvanically coupled to the protected metal and is
consumed (sacrificed) during protection.

Seal - An adhesive agent, such as sealant, used to
close or secure parts to prevent leaks. Seals may also
be created by compressive interference, such as O-
rings, plugs, and interference fit fasteners.

Sealant - A continuous thick film, with low cohesive
strength, which prevents the passage of liquids or
gasses.

Shelf Life - The length of time an unopened container
can be stored at the recommended storage temperature
and still retain the properties required by the specification.

Solvent - A liquid substance capable of dissolving or
dispersing another substance.

T

Tack-Free Time - The length of time required for a
curing sealant to lose its surface tackiness.

Thixotropic - A property of certain gels to liquefy when
shaken or stirred and then return to a hardened state
upon standing.

Titration - A method or process of determining the
concentration of a dissolved substance by adding to it
a standard reagent of known concentration in carefully
measured amounts until a reaction (color change or
electrical measurement) is completed.

Top Coat -The final paint film applied to a surface.

Total Environment - The circumstances and conditions
which surround and influence the equipment. The total
environment includes manufacturing, storage, shipping,
mission, maintenance, and repair.

U

Ultraviolet (UV) Light - Light of a wavelength band
shorter than visible light but longer than X-ray radiation.
Longer wavelength UV from the sun causes sunburn.
Shorter wavelength UV from unfiltered UV lamps can
damage unprotected eyes.

Unacceptable Response - A detrimental abnormality
in system performance.

Undesirable Response - A tolerated interruption of
normal performance.

Uniform Surface Corrosion - Corrosive etching of
metal involving only the surface.

V

Viscosity - The degree to which a fluid resists flow
under an applied force.

Void Seal - A seal used to fill holes, channels, and other
voids in a fuel tank. The void seal provides continuous
sealing, while a fillet seal would be interrupted by
structural gaps.

Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) - Compounds in
paints and solvents that dissolve into the air. VOC
content is restricted in many materials due to
environmental regulations.

W

Water Spotting - The change in surface appearance
resulting from the action of water standing on the paint
film or substrate. Spotting usually is caused by water
sensitivity of the coating, although the defect can be the
result of dissolved material deposited as water
evaporates.

Wet Edge - The ability of a wet coating to blend
smoothly together in the overlap areas during application.

Wet Installed Fastener - Fasteners that have sealant
applied to the shank and under the head prior to
installation to provide a corrosion barrier and secondary
seal.

Wrap Around - The phenomenon by which electrically
charged paint droplets curve around the rear side of the
object being painted.
